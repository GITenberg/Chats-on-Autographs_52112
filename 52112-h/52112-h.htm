<p><span class="smcap">Mr. T. Fisher Unwin</span> has asked me to "chat" on
autographs and autograph collecting. Fifteen years
ago the late Dr. George Birkbeck Hill "talked" on
the same subject in compliance with a similar request.
Still more recently Mr. Adrian H. Joline, of New
York, has given the world his "meditations" on a
pursuit which another American unkindly describes
as "that dreadful fever," but which Mr. Joline, as
well as the present writer, regards in the light of
"the most gentle of emotions." Mr. Joline expressed,
on the first page of his interesting book, a
profound conviction that nobody could by any
possibility be persuaded to read it unless already
interested in the topic with which it so effectively
deals. One of the principal objects of the <i>causeries</i>
I have undertaken to write is to reach, if possible,
a public to which the peculiar fascination and indescribable
excitement of the autograph cult are
still unknown, and to demonstrate (to a certain
extent from my own personal experience), the
practical utility, as well as the possibilities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
material profit, inherent in this particular form of
literary treasure-trove. For the benefit of the uninitiated
(and in this case the uninitiated are in a
vast majority) it is necessary at the onset to
differentiate between the "Autograph Fiend" (the
phrase is, I believe, American in its origin), who
pesters, often with unpardonable persistence, well-known
personages for their signatures in albums
or on photographs, and the discriminating collector
who accumulates for the benefit of posterity either
important documents or the letters of famous men.
"Nothing," writes Horace Walpole, "gives us so just
an idea of an age as genuine letters, nay history waits
for its last seal from them."</p>

<p>Adopting the words of one of the most gifted
letter-writers who ever lived as a text, let me clearly
define an autograph for the purposes of these pages
to be:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>A letter or document written or signed by any given
person.</i></p>

<p>An autograph collector, as I understand the term,
is one who acquires and arranges documents of the
sort now described. A collector of autograph signatures
has nothing in common with the scientific
autograph collector. Those who deliberately cut
signatures from important letters are in reality the
worst enemies both of the autograph collector and
the historian. Vandalism of this kind (often committed
in happy unconsciousness of the consequences)
brings with it its own punishment, for detached
signatures are almost worthless. Many years ago a
dealer was offered sixteen genuine signatures of
Samuel Pepys, their owner naïvely remarking that
"he had cut them from the letters <i>to save trouble</i>."
As a matter of fact he had in the course of a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
seconds depreciated the value of his property to the
extent of at least £150. The letters (if intact) would
have fetched from £15 to £20 each! "Album
Specimens"&mdash;the results of the misplaced energy of
the "autograph hunter," are of very little value as
compared with holograph letters, and collections of
this kind, although often elaborately bound up and
provided with a lock and key, generally prove a
woeful disappointment to the representatives of those
who bestowed so much time and trouble on their
formation. Collections of "franks," or the signatures
in virtue of which Peers and Members of the House
of Commons prior to 1840 could transmit letters
through the post free of charge, must not be classed
with those of "clipped" or isolated signatures.
"Frank Collections" were often very interesting,
and in the early years of the nineteenth century
many well-known people devoted much time and
trouble to their completion. The subject will be
further alluded to in my text.</p>

<p>Although a personal element must of necessity
pervade to some extent, at least, my chats on
autographs, it is obvious that the subject is one
which necessitates the greatest discretion. I shall
carefully refrain from using any letter which has
ever been addressed to me personally, although I
have ventured to reproduce the signature of H.R.H.
Ismail Pacha, one of the most remarkable men of his
time, and that of Arabi Pacha, for whom I acted as
counsel before the court-martial held at Cairo on
December 2, 1882. Between 1884 and 1889 I was in
constant correspondence with the late ex-Khedive
Ismail, and from 1883 down to the present day I
have frequently exchanged letters with my once
celebrated Egyptian client, who returned from exile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
some five years ago to spend the rest of his life in
Cairo. Nor shall I, with one or two exceptions, give
<i>in extenso</i> the letters of any living person, or letters
which can possibly give pain or concern to others.
Those who carefully study, as I do, the catalogues
issued from time to time by dealers in autographs,
both in this country and abroad, must often be
astonished at the rapidity with which the letters
of Royal and other illustrious personages "come into
the market." At the death of a well-known authoress
a few years ago the whole of the letters addressed to
her were sold <i>en bloc</i>. I was not surprised to learn
that the appearance of these "specimens" was the
cause of much consternation and many heart-burnings.</p>

<p class='center'>(The latter in both Arabic and English.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The present age is essentially one of "collecting,"
and I hope to convince those who are interested in
collecting generally, but have not yet included autographs
in their sphere of operations, that a great
opportunity awaits them, and that no form of
collecting, either from a literary or antiquarian
point of view, possesses greater charm or greater
possibilities. In his recent works on the private life
of Napoleon, M. Frédéric Masson has shown the
inestimable value of autograph letters to the historian,
and it is from unpublished and hitherto unknown
MSS. in public and private collections that Dr. J.
Holland Rose has obtained much of the new information
which will give exceptional value to his
forthcoming "Life of Pitt." If there is, as Mr.
Adrian Joline points out, an abundance of "gentle
emotion" to be found in the cult of the autograph,
there is also no lack of pleasurable excitement. If
autograph frauds, forgeries, and fakes are abundant,
autograph "finds" are equally so. There is an indescribable
pleasure in the detection of the former,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
and an amount of enjoyable excitement connected
with the latter, which none but the keen
collector can entirely realise. Having convinced the
antiquarian of the quite exceptional value of the
autograph as a collecting subject, I shall hope to
show my readers how they may most rapidly and
most economically obtain that special knowledge
necessary to become an expert. The autograph
market, as at present constituted, is a very small
one, but it is growing rapidly, and there is at
this moment no better investment than the highest
class of historical and literary autographs, provided
one exercises proper discretion in purchasing
and is content to wait for opportunities which
often occur. The truth of my assertion as to the
possibilities of profit in autograph collecting was
never more clearly demonstrated than at the
sale, in December, 1909, of the library of Mr.
Louis J. Haber, of New York City, which was conducted
by the Anderson Auction Company. Two
days were exclusively devoted to autographs, and
Mr. Haber has subsequently communicated to me
a complete list of the prices at which he bought and
sold the literary <i>rariora</i> now dispersed. The sensation
of the sale was the selling of a letter of John
Keats for £500. For this letter (an exceptionally
fine and interesting one) Mr. Haber originally paid
£25. Nevertheless, as I shall have occasion to point
out, the English collector might have picked up some
bargains at the Haber sale. An autograph poem by
Edmund Burke, written in 1749, was sold for £4 8s.,
and I envy the purchaser of the characteristic letter
of Lord Chesterfield, knocked down to some fortunate
bidder for £3 8s. I do not hesitate to say that the
Burke poem and the Chesterfield letter would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
fetched double the prices realised at Sotheby's. A
letter of Mrs. Piozzi's (not improved by inlaying)
fetched £8 12s. Mr. Haber gave £2 8s. for it, and I
have bought a dozen equally good Piozzi letters at
considerably less than that.</p>

<p>The <i>bonne camaraderie</i> which exists amongst autograph
collectors is exemplified by the ready assistance
rendered me in the preparation of my "chats." Dr.
H. T. Scott, who has devoted the greater part of his
life to the practical study of the subject, has given me
many valuable hints; Mr. Telamon Cuyler, the future
historian of Georgia, has rendered me important
help in the matter of American autographs and
autograph collecting; Mr. Charles De F. Burns, of
New York, has given me (through Mr. Cuyler) most
interesting data concerning the development of a
fondness for autographs in the United States; while
Dr. Thos. Addis Emmet has sent me the catalogue
of his unrivalled collection of American MSS. now in
the Lenox Library, New York. I tender my best
thanks for the aid in various directions which I have
received from Mr. Bernard Quaritch; Mr. Turner,
President of the Anderson Auction Company, New
York; Mr. Goodspeed, of Boston; Monsieur Noël
Charavay, of Paris; Messrs. Maggs, Mr. J. H. Stonehouse,
of Messrs. Sotheran, and Mr. W. V. Daniell;
while Professor M. Gerothwohl, Litt.D., of the
University of Bristol, has kindly translated the important
letter of the Empress Catharine of Russia,
and one or two other difficult examples of eighteenth-century
French. My acknowledgments are also due
to Mr. John Lane and Messrs. Harper Brothers, who
have kindly allowed me to use certain illustrations,
originally given in my books published by them; as
well as to the proprietors of <i>The Country Home</i> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
allowing me to reproduce some of the autographs
which first appeared in connection with the articles I
have had the honour to contribute to that journal.</p>

<p>If I succeed in awakening an extended and more
intelligent interest in autographs and autograph
collecting, I shall have done something in my
generation to help future historians, whose task
must, of necessity, become increasingly difficult as
time goes on. When I "commenced" collecting on
my own account, to borrow an old-world, eighteenth-century
phrase, I was literally groping in the dark,
and necessity compelled me to buy my experience.
I do not think I purchased it dearly. M. Noël
Charavay thinks all good judges of autographs are
near-sighted, and possibly this helped me in the early
stages of my collecting career to distinguish the
genuine article from a forged imitation. By attending
to the hints which I shall give in the proper place
the young collector will soon be able to recognise
the original from the counterfeit. As the values
of autographs increase (as they are sure to do) the
temptation to forgery becomes greater, and consequently
the application of the maxim <i>caveat emptor</i>
more urgent. Respectable autograph dealers
guarantee the letters they sell, but even experts are
occasionally mistaken. Quite recently I lighted on a
letter of Archbishop Fénelon in America, and thought
I had secured a bargain. The source from which it
came was unimpeachable, but M. Noël Charavay
immediately confirmed my opinion that it was a
lithographic forgery. There is, at any rate, one
privilege that the autograph collector alone enjoys.
It is difficult to say that any particular piece of china,
medal, coin, print, or postage stamp is unique. There
is always the danger of a duplicate turning up. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
autograph letters, on the other hand, each specimen
may fairly be described as "absolutely unique." I
have only once met with an exception to this rule.
Some twenty days before his death Charles Dickens
wrote a letter in duplicate to Buckstone the actor.
To avoid the possibility of its miscarrying one was
addressed to the theatre, and the other to Sydenham.
I have the former and should much like to know
what has become of the other, but even in this case
the letters are not precisely identical.</p>

<p>So vast is the range of autographs (taking the
subject as a whole and the term in its broadest
sense) that the collector of the rising generation will
do well to limit his sphere of operations to one
particular subject or locality. It is only by doing
this he can hope to arrive at anything like finality, or
to make his acquisitions really useful from an historical
point of view. Let him make the worthies of his
own county, or birthplace, or calling the objective of
his researches, and he will soon feel encouraged to go
further afield. As long ago as 1855 a writer in the
<i>Athenæum</i> remarked that "the story of what history
owes to the autograph collector would make a pretty
book." The present and future possibilities of autograph
collecting as the handmaiden of history-making
cannot be more forcibly illustrated than by the perusal
of the marvellous catalogue issued by Messrs. Pearson,
of Pall Mall Place, while these pages were going
through the press. Here we have a collection of
autographs by English sovereigns valued at £1,600,
one of musical composers priced at £2,500, and
another of 105 letters by great artists, beginning with
Antonio del Pollajuolo (born in 1426) and ending
with Corot, who died in 1875, for which £3,500, or
an average price of £35 each is asked. Modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
historians will possibly be more interested in the
portfolios of <i>unpublished</i> letters by Marlborough,
Burke, and Pitt, of which the House of Pearson is at
present the custodian. Without reference to them it
will be impossible to say that the last word has been
said about these three great men, who played in turn
so important a part in our national annals. Their
ultimate owner may have the opportunity of assisting
the historian in the manner I have ventured to
indicate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> friend Judge Philbrick, for some time President
of the Royal Philatelic Society of London, tells me
that the stamps known to collectors as the Post
Office Mauritius "fetch anything." In his opinion
a pair of fine examples of the 1d. red and 2d. blue
would easily make £2,500. He believes the King,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
when Prince of Wales, gave £1,500 for a single specimen.
A set of the rarest issues of Sandwich Island
stamps would be worth from £1,500 to £2,000, and
there are at least twenty or thirty varieties which
sell at something between £50 and £100. As a
matter of fact, I believe the single "Mauritius Post
Office" referred to exchanged hands in January
1904, at no less a figure than £1,950, and that at a
moment when much excitement was caused in autographic
circles by the appearance at Sotheby's of
thirty-three pages of the MS. of "Paradise Lost,"
once the property of Jacob Tonson the publisher.
The ultimate fate of this precious MS. will be referred
to in connection with the subject of Milton's autographs,
but it may be noted that in the same month
a series of seven superb folio holograph letters of
Napoleon, written during his first campaign in Italy,
when his handwriting was still legible and his signature
not the perplexing variation of scratches and
blots of later days, was knocked down at the comparatively
modest figure of £350, or less than one-fifth
of the sum paid for the "Mauritius Post Office"!
Before me lie several of the priced catalogues of
the Sotheby autograph auctions of six years ago.
Very few of the totals realised at these sales approached
the price paid for this single stamp. At one
of them Nelson's original letter-book of 1796-97,
including the original drafts of 67 letters (many of
them of first-rate importance) failed to fetch more
than £190, while a two days' sale (that of December
5 and 6, 1904) brought only an aggregate sum of
£1,009 16s., notwithstanding the fact that the 416
lots disposed of comprised a splendid series of Johnson
and Thrale letters, a series of S. T. Coleridge MSS.,
and fine examples of letters by Pope, Richardson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
Marvell, Burke, Boswell, Goldsmith, Garrick, Nelson,
and Lady Hamilton, together with historical documents
signed by Queen Elizabeth, the two Charleses,
Oliver Cromwell, and Queen Anne. The items thus
disposed of would in themselves have made a fine
collection if acquired by any one owner, for they
represent the most interesting phases of our national
annals, and they might have been acquired <i>en bloc</i> for
£940, less than half the cost of that one most expensive
stamp. Far be it from me to disparage a sister
"hobby." All I seek to prove is that autograph collection
has moderation in price to recommend it, as
well as that inherent interest which Mr. Joline alludes
to as "the gentlest of emotions."</p>

<p>In theory, at any rate, the lover of autographs can
claim for his favourite pursuit an antiquity of origin
which no print collector or philatelist, however enthusiastic,
can possibly pretend to. In some shape
or another MSS. were highly prized by the ancient
Egyptians as well as the Greeks and Romans. The
word "autograph" first occurs in the writings of
Suetonius. We learn on good authority that Ptolemy
stole the archives of the Athenians and replaced the
originals with cunningly devised copies; Pliny and
Cicero were both collectors after the manner of
the time in which they lived; Nero recorded his impressions
in pocket-books, and manuscripts of untold
importance are supposed to lie buried in the lava-covered
dwellings of Herculaneum. The Chinese,
too, at a very remote period of their national existence
were wont to decorate their temples with
the writing or the sign-manuals of their defunct
rulers. The Emperors Justinian and Theodoric are
both reputed to have affixed their signatures by the
aid of a perforated tin plate; and the mystery which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
attaches itself to the Epistles of Phalaris still awaits
some definite solution. These, and a dozen other
similar topics, may concern the history of writing in
the abstract, but they are strange to the question of
the genesis of the modern autograph in the sense
already sufficiently defined and as considered from
the collector's point of view.</p>

<p>By the irony of fate the origin of autograph collecting,
as we now understand it, is clearly traced to
the <i>alba amicorum</i> of the latter part of the sixteenth
and the first decades of the seventeenth century.
Men and women of light and leading were accustomed
to carry about oblong volumes of vellum,
on which their friends and acquaintances were
requested to write some motto or phrase under his
or her signature. Several interesting examples of
these <i>alba</i> are to be seen amongst the Sloane MSS.
in the British Museum. The earliest of them (No.
851) bears the date 1579. It commences with the
motto and signature of the Duc d'Alençon, the
suitor of our Virgin Queen. He has attempted a
sketch, something like a fire, under which are the
words "Fovet et disqutit Francoys," and below, "Me
servir quy mestre Farnagues."</p>

<p>No. 3,416 is bound in green velvet with the arms
of the writers beautifully emblazoned on each page.
On one of these the Duke of Holst, brother-in-law of
James I., has written:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Par mer et par terre<br /></span>

<p>To the album of Charles de Bousy (No. 3,415)
Edward Sackville, afterwards Earl of Dorset, has
contributed a motto neatly written in six languages.
Late in the nineteenth century these ancient <i>alba</i>
had their counterpart in the books of questions which,
for a brief period, found favour in the eyes of the
British hostess with a literary turn of mind. A page
thus filled up by the late Duke of Coburg (Prince
Alfred of England) is in my collection. In it the writer
with perfect frankness discloses his ideas of happiness
and misery, his favourite poets, painters, and
composers, his pet aversions and the characters in
history he most dislikes. The sheet of this modern
<i>album amicorum</i> fetched one sovereign in the open
market, and in many ways the views of the Duke are
as interesting as those of the princes and poets who
yielded to the entreaties of Charles de Bousy and
Christopher Arnold.</p>

<p>In these early <i>alba</i> the interest of the handwriting
formed the predominant attraction, but with the
succeeding generations of collectors who gathered
together stores of priceless MSS. the point of
interest was almost entirely historical. It was
reserved for the nineteenth century connoisseur to
combine the interest which is purely historical with
that which centres in the writer and the writing of
any given letter or document. The value of the
services rendered to the cause of history by men like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
Sir Robert Bruce Cotton (1571-1631), John Evelyn
(1620-1706), Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford
(1661-1724), Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford
(1689-1741), and Sir Hans Sloane (1660-1753)
cannot possibly be over-estimated.</p>

<p>Robert Harley purchased the papers accumulated
by Fox, Stow, and D'Ewes, and the Harleian and
Sloane MSS. form to-day a most important portion
of the national collection in the British
Museum. Thomas Hearne (1678-1735) laboured
industriously at Oxford on the same lines as
Robert Harley and Hans Sloane. He is said to
have made each important discovery of autographic
treasure-trove the subject of a devout
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Good work was done about the same time by
Ralph Thoresby (1658-1725) and Peter Le Neve
(1661-1729). Manuscripts entered largely into the
"Museum of Rarities" formed by the first named, and
the MSS. of the latter are now in the Bodleian Library
and the Heralds' College. A little later came James
West (1704-1772). Between 1741 and 1762 he held
the office of Joint-secretary to the Treasury, and
from 1746 till his death he was Recorder of Poole.
Among other curiosities he got together a large
number of valuable MSS. Born four years before
West, James Bindley lived till 1818, thus becoming
a contemporary of Upcott, Dawson Turner, and
other early nineteenth-century collectors who prepared
the way for the great work since accomplished
by Mr. Alfred Morrison and others.</p>

<p>It now becomes necessary to say something of the
"frank," which for more than an entire century
exercised the minds of men and women in every
condition of life to an extent it is now almost impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
to understand. The interest in the "frank"
was philatelic as well as autographic, but no
"frank" ever attained the high position now held by
a Post Office Mauritius or early Sandwich stamp.
The story of the "frank" is briefly thus: The right
to send letters free of charge was claimed by
Members of Parliament as far back as the reign of
James I. It was fully discussed in the Commons
immediately after the Restoration, and the claim was
affirmed, although the Speaker, Sir Harbottle Grimston,
refused to put a motion which he stigmatised as
"a poor mendicant proviso unworthy of the honour
of the House." The Lords rejected the Bill, because
apparently the privilege was not to be extended to
them, but it was eventually conceded to members of
both Houses. The grossest abuses were soon committed.
Under the cover of the "frank" fifteen
couple of hounds were sent to the King of the Romans;
"two maid-servants going out as laundresses" were
forwarded to "My Lord Ambassador Methuen," two
bales of stockings found their way, "post free," to
our representative at the Court of Portugal. The
"frank" was continually used for the transit of live
deer, turkeys, and haunches of venison. In Queen
Anne's time its operation was limited to packets
weighing two ounces or less, and in the fourth year
of George III. it was enacted that the "franking"
Peer or M.P. should write the whole address and
date on each letter. In 1795 the maximum weight
of a "franked" letter was reduced to one ounce, and
in 1840, on the institution of Sir Rowland Hill's
penny postage system, the privilege (except in one
or two special cases) was entirely abolished. Mr.
Bailie, of Ringdufferin, Killyleagh, Co. Down, was
one of the last of the frank-collecting enthusiasts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
About twenty years ago he thus wrote to the
<i>Archivist</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Although no further limitation or alteration was
made between 1795 and 1840, great abuses still
existed. Members supplied larger packets of franks
to friends and adherents; some sold their privilege
for large sums to banking and business firms; they
also accepted <i>douceurs</i> for allowing letters to be
directed to them, although intended for other
persons, and servants' wages were frequently paid by
franks, which were subsequently sold by them to
tradesmen and others. It was computed that a
banking house, having one of the firm an M.P.,
effected thereby a saving of £700 a year. In one
week of November, 1836, about 94,700 franks passed
through the London post alone, and in 1837 there
were 7,400,000 franked letters posted. From 1818
to 1837 it was estimated that £1,400,000 had been
lost to the Post Office through the franking system."
The privilege was abolished on July 10, 1840, the
only exception made being in favour of the late
Queen's own letters and a few Government Departments.</p>

<p>The Inspectors of Franks in London, Dublin, and
Edinburgh were highly paid and important officials.
Mr. William Tayleure, of Adelaide Street, West
Strand, headed a long list of dealers in "franks."
"Frank" auctions, prior to 1840, were as common as
stamp auctions are to-day, and amongst the best
known "frank" collectors were Lady Chatham
(the daughter-in-law of the "Great Commoner"), Lord
William FitzRoy and Mr. Blott, Inspector of Franks
at the G.P.O. Mr. Bailie eventually became possessor
of the Chatham and FitzRoy collections. He could
boast of possessing the "frank" of every Peer since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
the Union, with the single exception of F. A. Hervey,
Earl of Bristol and Bishop of Derry.</p>

<p>For three generations at least one of the principal
objects in life seems to have been the gratuitous
acquisition of "franks." When James Beattie visited
the Thrales of Streatham, his supreme delight lay in
having secured six "franks" and the promise of a
further supply; millionaires excused their epistolary
silence on the plea of the difficulty to "get" a
"frank," and even late in the "eighteen-thirties"
Benjamin Disraeli wrote to his sister that he was
sure that the sight of an unprivileged (<i>i.e.</i>, unfranked)
letter on the Bradenham breakfast-table would cause
the death of his venerable father.</p>

<p>The witty letters of Joseph Jekyll abound in
amusing allusions to "franks." One day he writes,
"Don't go into histericks at a Radical frank of
Burdett's"; on another occasion, "I have bribed the
Attorney-General for this frank," and again, "I postponed
payment till the immaculate electors of Stockbridge
had agreed to save <i>ninepence</i> out of your pin-money."
Writing to Lady Blessington the Nestor
of <i>beaux esprits</i> says: "I trust this will reach you if
the Post Office can decipher my friend Wetherell's
hieroglyphical frank, but Tories always make a bad
hand of it."</p>

<p>Collections of "franks" like those of Mr. Bailie
must still have some value. It is now difficult to
obtain isolated examples, and to my mind they are
infinitely more interesting, from every point of view,
than detached signatures of individuals, however
celebrated, and the great majority of "album
specimens."</p>

<p>An "album specimen" is a letter or signature
obtained in answer to a request for an autograph. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
the demand is made point-blank, the reply is rarely
of any real value.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many exceptions to the rule.
I have already alluded to the page of the "Confessions"
Book filled up by the late Duke of Coburg.
Bismarck is said to have been requested to add
something on the page of an autograph album which
already contained the autographs of Guizot and
Thiers. The former had written, "I have learned in
my long life two rules of prudence. The first is to forgive
much; the second, never to forget." Thiers had
placed below this the sentence, "A little forgetting
would not detract from the sincerity of the forgiveness."
Bismarck continued, "As for me, I have learnt
to forget much, and to be asked to be forgiven much."
I should not be surprised if the page of that album
with the conjunction of these three great names
yielded a record price.</p>

<p>It is the persistent seeker for "album specimens"
who is known in America as the "Autograph Fiend,"
and on this side as the "Autograph Hunter." Possibly
in the United States this type of collector is
more aggressive than his English <i>confrère</i>. Longfellow
was an early victim of the "A. F." In his
diary he plaintively mentions the necessity of complying
with thirty or forty requests of this kind.
On January 9, 1857, matters reached a climax. On
that day he made the following entry in his journal:
"To-day I wrote, sealed, and dictated seventy autographs."
Other celebrities were less complacent than
the persecuted poet. "George Eliot" generally instructed
Mr. Lewes to write a point-blank refusal,
and an Archbishop of York intended to follow her
example, but unintentionally delighted his tormentor
with the signed reply, "Sir, I never give my autograph,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
and never will." Frowde was in the habit of
replying after this fashion:&mdash;</p>

and some have done that. In one point you stand alone: you
have sent me the stamps for my post office, not the stamps
for yours. What is asked with so much consideration I take
a pleasure to grant. Here, since you value it, and have been

<p>For the one civil autograph collector, Charles R.</p></div>

<p>Poe, like Longfellow, was merciful to his autograph-seeking
correspondents, and their name was
legion. In his opinion, "The feeling which prompts
to the collection of autographs is a natural and rational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
one." Thackeray and Dickens were equally considerate
in the matter of these autograph petitions.
More years ago than I care to recollect a young
cousin of mine wrote to the former, and received,
almost by return of post, a signed and dated card
with a clever little sketch of a young lady inspecting
an album. At the present moment this particular
"specimen" is worth at least £10.</p>

<p>The most successful type of "Autograph Fiend"
is the man who is able, on some clever pretence, to
extract a letter of real interest and importance from
his unconscious victim. Since I began to collect I
have carefully watched the operation of these pious
frauds, and am often astonished at the ease with
which political, literary, and artistic celebrities fall
into an all too transparent trap. Portrait painters
are ready to send estimates to persons they never
heard of; grave theologians are led by impostors
into discussions on abstruse questions of faith and
belief; astute statesmen like Mr. Chamberlain are
induced to enlarge on burning problems of the
hour; and venerable artists like Sir John Tenniel
are apparently ready to furnish two pages of
reminiscences for the mere asking. In the
"eighteen-fifties" a swindler named Ludovic Picard
acquired a really valuable series of autographs by
writing to men like Béranger, Heine, Montalembert,
and Lacordaire letters in which he posed as one of
"the odious race of the unappreciated who meditated
suicide, and sought in his hour of sore distress for
valuable counsel and advice." Lacordaire sent him
ten closely-written pages of earnest appeal, and
Charles Dickens, who happened to be at Boulogne,
fell an easy victim to the wiles of "Miserrimus,"
who was finally unmasked by Jules Sandeau while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
carousing with a party of boon companions at a
tavern. Dickens wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Voici encore de bons remèdes contre votre affliction!
Surtout, on doit se souvenir constamment de la bonté du

félicités et misères de ces pauvres voisins dans cette vie de
vicissitudes. Voici encore une manière de s'élever le c&#339;ur

<p>A query sent to Sir John Tenniel on the subject
of the private theatricals at Charles Dickens's elicited
this interesting letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'>
<i>October 13, 1903.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;With many apologies for the delay, absolutely
unavoidable, I have much pleasure in offering you such
information as the only surviving representative of the "Guild
of Literature and Art" and a memory of over fifty years
may be able to supply in answering your polite letter of the
8th inst. received on Saturday.</p>

<p>The first performance of "Not so Bad as we Seem," at
Devonshire House, in the presence of the Queen, the Prince
Consort, and the Court, most certainly took place on the
<i>16th</i> of May, 1851, just five months after I had joined the
<i>Punch</i> staff.</p>

<p>But there was also a <i>second</i> grand performance of the play
on the <i>27th</i>, to which the friends of the actors and distinguished
people were invited by special invitation of the Duke.</p>

<p>Happily, after an almost hopeless search, I have found the
bill of the play (which please to return when done with) of
that performance, which is identical with the first except
that the farce of "Mr. Nightingale's Diary," by Dickens and
Mark Lemon, was <i>not</i> produced for the delectation of
"Royalty"! Bill will also give you the names of the <i>dramatis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
personæ</i>, and you will see that the names of Maclise and Leech
are not included in the list.</p>

<p>The last-named characters, some with only a line, some
with none, were alluded to, and cheerfully, except by certain
literary celebrities, and for myself "Hodge" was quite a good
little part.</p>

<p>In the following year, however, owing to Forster's illness,
the part of "Hardman" (a most important one) was at once
assigned to me, and it is to that which Dickens alludes in his
letter to Forster from Sunderland, August 29, 1852. I can
hardly suppose that this letter can be of the least use to
you, but</p>

catalogue at the modest price of 12s.</p>

<p>A candid friend writes to the Earl of Rosebery that
he is sorely troubled in conscience as to some difficulty
which has arisen in connection with the Premier's
patronage of the race-course. He obtains a reply,
seemingly after some demur:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear</span> &mdash;&mdash;, I did not the least in the world mean to
imply the slightest shadow of blame to you for asking the
question, which I do not doubt many other people are also
asking. But for all that I am not able to answer it, and
therefore you are unfettered in your treatment of it. It is
strange, as regards my own position towards the Sporting
League, Liberal candidates are abused on the ground that
Liberals are opposed to sport, and then, on the other hand,
the Nonconformist Conscience fires a broadside into him for
what is thought to be too much allied to sport.</p>

<p class='right'>
<span class="mr4">Yours very truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap mr2">Rosebery</span>.<br />
</p></div>

<p>Lord Rosebery's views on the elasticity of the
Nonconformist conscience were sold for a crown, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
the same price was asked and obtained for a letter
most ingeniously obtained from Mr. Chamberlain in
the very early days of Tariff Reform Agitation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<i>September 18, 1903.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;My correspondence is so enormous that I am
compelled to dictate my letters even to my most intimate
friends and relations, and the uncharitable suggestion that I
am too proud to reply to workmen in my own handwriting is
quite uncalled for.</p>

<p>I greatly appreciated your friendly letter and the compliment
which you and your wife propose to pay me and which
I readily accept. Tell me when the baby is to be baptized
and exactly what you mean to call him, and I will see if I can
find some little memento which may remind him in after
years of his namesake.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I am glad to know that the tariff question is
being discussed in your workshop. The time will come before
long when all the working men will see how seriously their
employment is threatened, and how necessary it is for them
that the Colonial Markets should be kept open. The future of
our trade depends on our relations with our kinsfolk across the
seas, and if we do not seize the opportunity offered to us by
them of increasing our trade with them we may not have
another chance, but when we desire it may find that they have
ceased to be willing. The Big Loaf cry is a sheer imposture.
Nothing that I have proposed would increase the cost of
living to any working man, and on the other hand it would
give him the certainty of better trade and more employment.
Wages, which depend upon employment, would tend to rise,
and labour would gain all round.</p>

<p>We have had wonderfully good trade during the last two
years, but there are signs approaching at present, and if they
are fulfilled and every trade in London suffers from the free
import of the surplus of foreign countries, the most bigoted
Free Trader will regret that he was not wise in time and
content to make preparation against the evil day.</p>

<p class='right'>
<span class="mr8">Truly yours,</span><br />

</p></div>

<p>The "Autograph Fiend" in this case certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
deserves his name. He not only succeeds in obtaining
an interesting letter, signed and carefully corrected
by an ex-Cabinet Minister, which he is able to convert
into five shillings, but he receives with it a promise
that the writer will become the godfather of his real
or supposed child!</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin's total lack of sympathy with the
autograph-hunter was notorious. He was also known
to entertain a strong antipathy to a certain conventicle.
The following response to a demand for
subscription elicited a very characteristic reply, which
was promptly converted into ten pounds. In the
presence of such recent examples of successful autograph
"draws" as these, there is no need to repeat
the old story of the Duke of Wellington's reply to
a fictitious demand for the payment of a washer-woman's
bill said to be due from Lord Douro.</p>

<p>Mr. John Ruskin to a correspondent:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am scornfully amused at your appeal to me, of all people in
the world, the precisely less likely to give you a farthing. My
first word to all men and boys who care to hear me is, Don't
get into debt. Starve and go to heaven&mdash;but don't borrow.
Try first begging&mdash;I don't mind, if it's really needful, stealing.
But don't buy things you can't pay for. And of all manner of
debtors, pious people building churches they can't pay for,
are the most detestable nonsense to me. Can't you preach
and pray behind the hedges&mdash;or in a sand-pit&mdash;or a coal-hole
first? And of all manner of churches thus idiotically built,
iron churches are the damnablest to me. And of all sects of
believers in ruling spirit&mdash;Hindoos, Turks, Feather Idolaters,
and any Mumbo-jumbo, Log and Fire Worshippers, your
modern English Evangelical sect is the most absurd, and
entirely objectionable and unendurable to me. All which they
might very easily have found out from my books&mdash;any other
sort of sect would&mdash;before bothering me to write to them.
Ever, nevertheless, and in all this saying, your faithful servant,</p>

<p>Autograph-hunting on the basis now exposed is
only pursued in the hope of gain from the sale of
the letter thus obtained. To attempt to form a
collection in such a manner might lead to very unpleasant
consequences. The only innocent form of
autograph-hunting is that so frequently witnessed at
concerts and musical festivals, and the albums thus
filled are ultimately sold for a price which would
sadly disappoint the original owner. In the next
chapter I shall endeavour to give the beginner in
autograph collecting such information as will enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
him not only to purchase genuine letters at the
lowest possible price, but to arrange and classify
them when so arranged to the greatest possible
advantage. My firm conviction that at the present
moment the judicious buying of autographs is one
of the best possible investments, does not lessen the
pleasure which we feel in examining those still-speaking
relics of the past which enable us to say

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> modern autograph collector has certain advantages
over his predecessors of the eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries which will compensate
him in some measure for the difficulty of procuring
choice specimens at the prices which ruled twenty
and even ten years ago. Foremost amongst these
advantages is facility of access to such autographic
treasure-houses as the British Museum, the Record
Office, and the National Library at Paris. It was
as recently as the late "eighteen-fifties" that the
priceless archives of the old India Office were
ruthlessly sacrificed by the lineal successors of
"John Company." Amongst other valuable MSS.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
the archives of the Indian Navy went <i>en bloc</i> to the
paper-mills. A single letter, blown accidentally from
one of the carts used by the contractors who carried
out this work of desolation, turned out to have been
written in the reign of James I. by the Duke of
Buckingham, and brought £5 to its finder. To-day
it is probably worth at least five times as
much again. The Record Office, in which such
State documents and official correspondence as have
survived the ignorance, carelessness, or iconoclasm
of the past, now find a home, is, comparatively
speaking, a modern institution. Notwithstanding
the havoc wrought by the <i>sans-culottes</i> of the
Terror and the Communists of forty years ago,
the National Library in Paris is to-day the home
of one of the most interesting collections of autographs
in the whole world, including, it is said, something
like ten thousand letters and documents written
or signed by Napoleon. It is probably the result of
the social upheavals of the past, and the wholesale
dispersal of the contents of public and private muniment
rooms towards the close of the eighteenth
century, that autograph "finds" are more frequently
made in Paris than anywhere else. It was there
that I acquired the marriage settlement of Pamela
FitzGerald,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> executed at Tournay on December 26,
1792, and a sixteenth-century deed in which mention
is made of a Royal Commission for the further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
exploration of Canada&mdash;<i>La Canadie</i>. Both of these
documents cost less than 10s., and one of them,
presented by me through Mr. Ross Robertson to
the Public Library at Toronto, has now been framed,
and is shown to visitors as a curiosity of the greatest
interest and rarity. These great public institutions
carry on in the twentieth century the good work
commenced long ago by men like Evelyn, the
Harleys, and Sloane.</p>

<p>The first thing I should advise an intending
collector to do is to procure the "Guide to the
MSS., Autographs, &amp;c., exhibited in the Department
of MSS. and in the Grenville Library of the British
Museum."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This useful little volume contains no
less than thirty plates of various descriptions, ranging
from the articles of the Magna Charta and a
page from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to Nelson's
last letter to Lady Hamilton, and examples of the
handwriting of Marlborough, Wellington, Washington,
Chatham, and Keats. At the end is a list of
the different series of autograph facsimiles issued at
intervals since 1895, and sold at a very moderate
price. Next to the careful study of original MSS.,
nothing is so important to the collector as the
careful and constant examination of well-executed
facsimiles like those obtainable at the British
Museum, where, at the cost of 7s. 6d., you can
get thirty plates. The first in order contains facsimiles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
of autograph letters by Queen Catharine of
Aragon, 1513; Archbishop Cranmer, 1537; Bishop
Hugh Latimer (marginal notes by Henry VIII.),
about 1538; Edward VI., 1551; Mary, Queen of
Scots, 1571; English Commanders against the
Spanish Armada, 1588; Queen Elizabeth, 1603;
Charles I., 1642; Oliver Cromwell, 1649; Charles II.,

John Keats, 1820; Charles Dickens, 1870; W. M.
Thackeray, 1851; Thomas Carlyle, 1832; and Robert
Browning, 1868.</p>

<p>Numerous collections of facsimiles have been
published in England, France, and Germany, and
the prudent collector must secure one or more of
these invaluable aids to the identification of MSS.
Most of the best catalogues issued, both in London
and Paris, contain several facsimiles, but that does
not lessen the utility of books like "Autographs of
Royal, Noble, Learned, and Remarkable Personages
conspicuous in English History from the Reign of
Richard II. to that of Charles II., with some illustrious
Foreigners; containing many passages from
important letters" (engraved under the direction
of Charles John Smith and John Gough Nichols:
London, 1829, 1 vol. 4to); or "A Collection of One
Hundred Characteristic and Interesting Autograph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
Letters written by Royal and Distinguished Persons
of Great Britain from the XV. to the XVIII. Century,
copied in perfect facsimile from the originals by
Joseph Nethercliff" (London, 1849). Several useful
facsimiles are to be found in "A Guide to the
Collector of Historical Documents, Literary MSS.,
and Autograph Letters," by the Rev. Dr. Scott
and Mr. Samuel Davey, published in 1891. Dr.
H. T. Scott is also responsible for a handy little
volume, entitled "Autograph Collecting, a Practical
Manual for Amateurs and Historical Students,"
brought out three years later than the larger volume
by Mr. Upcott Gill.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, however, that our French
neighbours are far ahead of us in the matter of
facsimiles, as well as in other details connected
with autograph collecting. With us the subject is
only now beginning to receive the treatment it
merits. In the opinion of our neighbours the cult
of the autograph has for some generations held
rank as a science. I cannot too strongly impress
upon beginners the expediency of carefully watching
the Paris autograph market, and giving special
attention to the catalogues issued monthly by M.
Noël Charavay, of 3, Rue Furstenberg, and Madame
Veuve Gabriel Charavay, of 153, Faubourg St.
Honoré. At the Fraser Sale (April, 1901) I purchased
three huge volumes forming an extra-illustrated
copy of a portion of the famous "Letters
of Madame de Sévigné," compiled quite a century
ago at the cost of several hundred pounds, and finally
acquired by Miss Eliza Gulston. In it, in addition
to an enormous number of prints and portraits, were
several genuine autograph letters, supplemented by
a large number of facsimiles. Under the genuine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
letters the maker of the book wrote their source and
history; he divided the facsimiles into "tracings,"
"imitations by hand," and so forth. A copy of the
"Isographie des Hommes Célèbres," in two 4to
volumes, is now worth between £3 and £4, and the
late Mr. Étienne Charavay prepared two supplements
to it which are also extremely valuable. Between
March, 1888, and December, 1894, the late Mr.
Davey published a quarterly journal&mdash;the <i>Archivist</i>&mdash;which
bid fair to become as indispensable to the
English collector as the <i>Amateur d'Autographes</i>,
founded in the early "eighteen-forties" and now admirably
edited by M. Noël Charavay, is to his French
colleague. Every true lover of autographs must
deplore its untimely end, and the young collector
is indeed fortunate if he can obtain a set of it. In
it Dr. Scott, who was from the first its principal
contributor, places quite a mine of information at
the disposal of his readers. I regard the two bound
volumes of the <i>Archivist</i> in my possession as one
of the most useful books of reference obtainable in
the matter of autographs. In the forty odd volumes
of the <i>Amateur d'Autographes</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the student will
discover a liberal education, as far as his special
subject is concerned, ready at hand. The Charavay
Sale-catalogues are of great value in the matter of
arrangement and description, as well as for the facsimiles
they give in abundance. One of the finest
is that of the Alfred Bovet Collection, dispersed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
during the spring and early summer of 1884. It
was prepared by M. Étienne Charavay, and fills
over 800 4to pages plentifully illustrated with
sketches and numerous facsimiles. A very useful
book for beginners who read French is "Les Autographes
en France et le goût des Autographes en
France et à l'étranger" (Paris, 1865), by M. de Lescure.
It contains a useful list of the numerous books on
autographs published up to that date, together with
the various collections of facsimiles, many of which
can now be picked up on the bookstalls by the
side of the Seine or the adjoining streets for a few
francs. As far back as 1820 the Maison Delpech
commenced the publication of their various "Iconographies,"
of which the "Isographie des Hommes
Célèbres" was the natural successor. There are
one or two German books of facsimiles, like the
"Album von Autographen" (Leipzig, 1849) and
the "Sammlung histor: berühmter Autographen"
(Stuttgart, 1846-47). There is also a collection of five
hundred facsimiles, published in 1846 by F. Bogaerts.
I do not, of course, pretend to provide my readers
with a complete autographic bibliography, but
amongst the works I have mentioned he will find
all that is necessary to set about collecting in
earnest, and without fear of making many initial
blunders.</p>

<p>Having handled and carefully examined a number
of genuine autographs and having, by the study of
facsimiles, familiarised himself with the handwriting
of many famous men and women, the collector in
embryo may begin to buy, but it must be a case of
<i>festina lente</i>. How cautiously he should proceed he will
realise when, in the next chapter, I come to consider
the critical question of autograph frauds and forgeries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
All respectable autograph dealers are ready to guarantee
any specimen they offer for sale, and to take it
back if found to be "doubtful." It is from the careful
reading of the catalogues<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> issued from time to time
by dealers like Mr. Bernard Quaritch, of Grafton
Street, Dr. Scott, of 69, Mill Lane, West Hampstead,
Mr. W. V. Daniell, of 53, Mortimer Street, Messrs.
Sotheran, of 37, Piccadilly, Messrs. Maggs, of 109,
Strand, Messrs. Ellis, of 29, New Bond Street, and
Messrs. Pearson, of Pall Mall Court, that one
obtains an insight into the current value of autographs
of every description. Mr. Frank Sabin, of
172, New Bond Street, does not, as a rule, issue
catalogues, but he possesses one of the most valuable
stocks of autographs in existence. His Thackeray,
Civil War, and Nelson collections are alone worth
many thousands of pounds. While this volume
was going through the press Mr. Sabin paid the
record sum of £8,650 for a collection of seventeenth-century
MSS. relating to America belonging
to Mr. R. W. Blathwayt. In the provinces
autograph catalogues are published now and then
by Mr. W. Brown, of Edinburgh, and Messrs.
Simmons &amp; Waters, of Leamington Spa. All these
gentlemen will readily send their catalogues on
application. I have already mentioned the two
excellent catalogues issued monthly in Paris. That
of M. Noël Charavay, entitled <i>Bulletin d'Autographs</i>,
has appeared ever since 1847. The <i>Revue des Autographs</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
of Madame Veuve Gabriel Charavay dates
from 1866. It is only right to say that autograph
collecting is pursued so keenly just now in France,
that unless they can arrange to obtain advance
copies of these catalogues, the best items in them
will probably be sold before their order arrives.
Catalogues are sometimes published by Herr Émile
Hirsch, of 6, Carl Strasse, Munich. The American
dealers will be spoken of in the chapter devoted
to the subject of autograph collecting in the United
States.</p>

<p>English autographs of exceptional interest are
often obtained abroad at far lower prices than in
London, and that fact makes it very necessary to
look carefully through the foreign catalogues. The
same remark doubtless applies to French and German
autographs in England. I obtained in Germany a
fine autograph letter of Charles I. for £10. It would
have fetched three times that amount in a London
auction-room. The same remark applies to a fine
letter of the Young Pretender, which came from
Paris and was priced only at 55 francs. On the
other hand I obtained in London for 15s. each
letters of Madame de Geoffrin and Madame du
Deffand, which would have cost twice or thrice as
much in Paris. In one of the latest French catalogues
which reached me, an English letter was
priced at 20 francs. In an English catalogue, a less
lengthy letter by the same writer was offered for
sale at £5. For 12 francs I once succeeded in
purchasing in Paris a letter of Lord Shelbourne,
covering ten pages and throwing quite new light on
the relations between the French and English Courts
at a certain epoch. The prices for fine autographs
in London are far higher than in Paris and Germany.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
A Paris dealer could hardly realise the possibility of
a Keats letter fetching £500 (12,500 francs), as at the
Louis J. Haber sale. It was thought quite wonderful
when a phenomenally early letter of Napoleon&mdash;I
believe the earliest known&mdash;was sold for 5,000
francs. This figure is, I believe, the highest ever
given in Paris for a single letter. In any case
this unique relic of the young Napoleon only
fetched about one-tenth of the price obtained for
the Post Office Mauritius stamp which caused so
much excitement in the philatelic world six years
since.</p>

</div>

<p>In the case of MSS. of every description it is
necessary to read them carefully. It is only by so
doing that you can hope to ascertain anything like
the real value. This remark applies particularly to
holograph letters. The cataloguer often omits the
name of the person to whom it is addressed, or some
sentence or allusion which adds materially to its
value. Thus a letter of Franklin addressed to
Washington, or letters by any of the French
marshals written to Napoleon, would be far more
valuable than ordinary letters of any of these personages.
A letter signed by the Russian Emperor
Paul would not be intrinsically valuable. But one
addressed to Nelson was lately priced at £14. The
time at which a letter is written is often an important
factor in determining its price. An ordinary letter
of Wellington, who wrote at least a hundred thousand
letters during his public career, can be bought for
3s. 6d. A note written on the evening of June 18,
1815, not long since realised £105. Then again,
letters acquire additional value when forming part of
a series. I purchased a letter of Sir Joshua Reynolds
to the poet Crabbe, mentioning a communication he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
was sending him for Dr. Johnson. Years after I
secured the precious enclosure. The two together
are obviously worth more than when taken singly.
I possess the splendid letter of George Crabbe,
appealing for help to Burke, which once belonged to
Sir Theodore Martin. I failed to secure Burke's
reply, which went, I believe, to the British Museum.
I gave a few francs in Paris for a letter of Anne
Darner's asking Madame de Staël to meet her at
Miss Berry's (the friend and literary executrix of
Walpole). Quite accidentally, in turning over a
pile of autographs in London, I came across the
reply, and a very characteristic one it was. At
the present moment both letters face the account
of the reunion in question in my extra-illustrated
copy of "The Journals and Correspondence of Miss
Berry."</p>

<p>Dr. Scott hopes I will impress upon my readers
the necessity of mending autographs as little as
possible. To clip or trim them is rank heresy, and
gives them at once the appearance of counterfeits.
Autographs must be treated with the greatest tenderness.
You can best strengthen decaying paper
by the careful application of diluted solution of gelatine.
There are several methods of rendering faded
writing again legible. According to one authority
the most effective agent is very finely powdered
chlorate of potash added to a decoction of galls,
<i>dabbed</i>, not rubbed, over the MS. When dry,
the surface should be sponged with lime-water.
Another expert advises that the paper should be
moistened, and a brush passed over the faded
portion wetted with a solution of sulphide of
ammonia, an infusion of galls, or a solution of
ferrocyanide of potassium slightly acidulated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
hydrochloric acid.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Personally I have found the
"A.P." brand of transparent adhesive tape invaluable
both in mending and hinging autographs, but worthless
imitations must be avoided. It can be bought
of all stationers, and with it I always use Higgins's
Photographic Paste. This may possibly be a little
extravagant, and an expert gives me the following
recipe for a useful paste in connection with
autographs:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take a tablespoonful of Glenfield's Patent Starch
and mix with a little cold water in an ordinary jam-pot,
then fill with boiling water. When cool it will
be ready for use."</p>

<p>The classification of autographs has given rise to
endless discussion. On this subject I am at issue
with Mr. Joline. Personally, I regard extra-illustration
as the most effective and interesting plan of
arranging and preserving autographs. Mr. Joline, on
the other hand, "meditates" upon extra-illustration
as only an incident or contingent possibility in autograph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
collection. I hope to deal with (to me) the
most fascinating subject of Extra-Illustration or
Grangerising in a separate volume. In an article
in <i>The Country Home</i> I have given examples of
the effective use of autographs in extra-illustration,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
and I can conceive no form of "the gentle emotion"
more enjoyable than that which one experiences
when one sees an appropriate autograph placed in
apposition to a fine portrait facing some text which
they combine strikingly and felicitously to illustrate.
In my "Chesterfield's Letters" I have a letter in
English from the Sage of Ferney to the Hermit of
Blackheath, together with a portrait of the same
date, opposite Chesterfield's account of his meeting
with and friendship for Voltaire. In an "extended"
Clarke and McArthur's "Life of Nelson," in immediate
contiguity to the account of one of his most
daring adventures, and the honours it brought him,
may be seen Nelson's original letter of thanks to
George III. (as touching an epistle as he ever
penned), together with a contemporary portrait in
water-colours. There is no better way of preserving
autographs than to house them between the leaves
of well-bound and carefully tended volumes. There
is no worse method than to frame them as a picture,
and expose them to the fading influence of a strong
light. I have seen autographs actually gummed to a
glass before being framed! If an accident occurs
the autograph generally shares the fate of the glass.
For the orderly keeping of the autographs and MSS.
which I have not utilised in the forty or fifty books
I have extra-illustrated since 1900, I employ a deep
folio-sized receptacle known as a Stone's "filing"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
cabinet, with alphabetical divisions.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It enables me
to find any given paper at a moment's notice.</p>

<p>I have made the necessities of extra-illustration
the mainspring, as it were, of my autograph collecting.
If the young autograph collector has no
specific object of this kind in view (and in the
course of ten years' hard work in the vineyard of
grangerising there are few kinds of autographs I
have not required) I should strongly recommend
him to begin with some specific line, be it soldiers
or sailors, painters or poets, actors and actresses,
men of letters, worthies of a particular city, county,
or college, and so forth. If this course is adopted
an interesting collection can be formed without
incurring enormous cost, and the value of good autographs
is sure to rise. It is given to few men in
a generation, or even in a century, to form collections
of a cosmopolitan and all-embracing character
like that made by the late Mr. Alfred Morrison
between the years 1865 and 1882, the catalogue of
which, prepared with the utmost care by M. A. W.
Thibaudeau, fills six folio and seven imperial octavo
volumes, and costs £60. French collectors pay great
attention to classification, and each letter is generally
placed in a <i>chemise</i> or cover bearing some heraldic or
other appropriate device. In the case of a small
collection like that which Sir George White, Bart.,
has acquired, of letters and documents relating
solely to Bristol, an alphabetical arrangement is
preferable. If, however, one gathers autographs of
all conceivable kinds, and "of all nations and languages,"
subdivisions become absolutely essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
if you want to find any particular specimen without
difficulty. I have already referred to the
Alfred Bovet Catalogue, prepared on scientific lines
by M. Étienne Charavay. In this collection the
many thousand items of which it consisted were
divided into&mdash;(1) Heads of Government; (2) Statesmen
and Political Personages; (3) The French
Revolution; (4) Warriors; (5) Men of Science and
Explorers; (6) Actors and Actresses; (7) Writers;
(8) Painters, Sculptors, Engravers, and Architects;
(9) Huguenots; and (10) Women. There was
a further subdivision according to nationalities,
and these were finally arranged chronologically.
The preface to the Bovet Catalogue, admirably
written by M. Étienne Charavay, has been published
separately under the attractive title of "The
Science of Autographs." It deserves to be translated
and published in English, for no more
thoughtful essay on the value of historical letters
and the cult of the autograph has ever appeared.
It is now time to consider the application of the
legal maxim of <i>caveat emptor</i> to the acquisition
of MSS. of every description. The presence of a
forgery will often discredit an otherwise interesting
and valuable collection. Not long ago I was
shown an album of autographs which represented
the gleanings of two or three generations of a highly
respectable county family. The moment I opened
it I recognised my old friend the Byron-Galignani
facsimile, which is offered to dealers as a rare specimen
at least once a week. The owner, who had paid
several pounds for it, declared he could vouch for
its genuineness beyond the shadow of a doubt! He
never quite forgave my taking down the Paris edition
of Byron's poems to convince him of his error.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I must</span> resist a strong temptation to enlarge on such
interesting topics as W. H. Ireland's wholesale manufacture
of Shakespearean MSS.; Thomas Chatterton's
ingenious fabrication of Rowley's poems, and
James Macpherson's alleged translations from Ossian.
The main object of Ireland and Chatterton was
obviously to deceive the world of letters rather
than the then little-known autograph collector with
whose interests I am solely concerned. By the
irony of fate, however, there are at the present
moment very few rarer or more costly autographs
than that of Thomas Chatterton, who might very
well have lived for a twelvemonth on the price paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
by Sir George White for four or five lines of his
handwriting scrawled on the back of a letter.
Chatterton died by his own hand, with starvation
staring him in the face, but Ireland lived to make
money by the "Confessions"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of his misdoings, and
more than thirty years ago £50 was paid for the
scathing letter addressed to Macpherson by Samuel
Johnson. The forger of autograph letters for the
purpose of entrapping the over-trustful or ignorant
collector is the product of the nineteenth century,
although some of the French imitations may possibly
be a little older. The modern forger obtains important
aid from photography, but by way of
compensation the enlargement of any given specimen
by the same means is invaluable for the purposes
of detection. The earliest imitations of autograph
letters I have ever seen are of French origin, and
are contained in the extra-illustrated copy of
Madame de Sévigné's Letters already alluded to.
They are frankly labelled as "tracings," "engravings,"
"lithographs," and so forth, and many
of them seem to have been executed on old paper
in order to simulate more completely the originals.</p>

</div>

<p>The inexperienced collector must, in the first
instance, beware of facsimiles of letters which have
been published <i>bonâ fide</i> as illustrations of works of
biography, and, having been extracted from them,
are offered for sale (sometimes innocently) as genuine
specimens. The most familiar instance of this is a
letter of Byron's addressed to "Mr. Galignani, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
18, Rue Vivienne, Paris." A facsimile of this, with
address, &amp;c., was prefixed to an edition of Byron's
poems published in Paris. Not long ago I saw
this lithographed facsimile figuring as genuine in a
valuable collection of holograph letters, the rest of
which were above suspicion.</p>

<p>This letter commences with the words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;In various numbers of your journal I have
seen mentioned a work entitled 'The Vampire'
with the addition of my name as that of the
author. I am not the author, and never heard of
the work in question until now," and ends with the
sentence, "You will oblige me by complying with
my request of contradiction. I assure you that I
know nothing of the work or works in question,
and have the honour to be (as the correspondents
to magazines say), 'your constant reader' and very
obedient servant, Byron." To this is added the
date, "Venice, April 27th, 1819." There is a
well-known facsimile of a letter of Lord Nelson
which occasionally does duty as an original. Some
years ago I saw it in a catalogue priced at several
pounds! It is inserted after the preface in T. O.
Churchill's "Life of Nelson," published in 1808,
and the paper is therefore not unlike that of the
period at which the letter is supposed to have been
written, and bears on the back the address, "To
Thomas Lloyd, Esq., No. 15, Mary's Buildings, St.
Martin's Lane, London." The original would be
worth quite ten guineas. Buyers of Nelson letters
should remember that this dangerous facsimile begins
as follows: "Bath, January 29th, 1798. My dear
Lloyd,&mdash;There is nothing you can desire me to do
that I shall not have the greatest pleasure in complying
with, for I am sure you can never possess a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
thought that is not strictly honourable. I was much
flattered by the Marquis's<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> kind notice of me, and I
beg you will make my respects acceptable to him.
Tell him that I possess his place in Mr. Palmer's
Box, but his Lordship did not tell me all its charms,
that generally some of the handsomest Ladys at
Bath are partakers in the Box, and was I a bachelor
I would not answer for being tempted, but as I am
possessed of everything that is valuable in a wife I
have no occasion to think beyond a pretty face"&mdash;and
so forth.</p>

</div>

<p>If either of these facsimiles had been touched with
the end of a sable brush moistened with muriatic
acid and water the print would remain unaffected.
In a genuine letter the writing if so touched would
grow faint or disappear. The same test may be
applied to photographs or imitations in sepia. I
once purchased a quaint note written by Edmund
Kean, of which a reproduction is now given. Nearly
a year later I saw an autograph, identical in every
particular, offered for sale. I sent for it, and on
applying the dilution of muriatic acid test found it to
be a copy in sepia of the note already in my possession.
The owner of the genuine note had sent it to
two or three applicants for inspection. It had been
traced over and then worked up in sepia. I once
discovered a letter of William Pitt the Elder to be a
forgery by the mere accident of the sun falling on it,
and showing a narrow rim round each letter. In
this case the basis was a photograph, touched up
with black paint.</p>

<p>The autograph collector soon becomes accustomed
to the appearance of genuine letters, for the creases
and stains of time cannot be perfectly imitated any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
more than the old-world appearance of seventeenth-
and eighteenth-century ink. Watermarks are a
good, but not an infallible, test of genuineness. The
thick, gilt-edged letter paper of quarto size used by
our ancestors cannot be satisfactorily counterfeited,
and the inexperienced buyer should eschew documents
of all sorts written on morsels of paper of
irregular size, which may have been torn from books,
and lack the usual tests of authenticity. Collectors
of autographs should bear in mind the facts that
"franks" ceased to be used after the introduction
of the penny postage in 1840; that envelopes were
first used about ten years earlier, and that the letters
denoting the various London postal districts did not
form part of the postmark till some time after the
invention of the adhesive stamp. A forged letter of
Thackeray was detected by the appearance of the
letter W. after London in the counterfeit postmark
quite ten years before it could have legitimately done
so. If hot water is applied to a genuine watermark,
it becomes clearer and stronger; if to a fabricated one
it disappears. The autograph collector should carefully
study a book which has quite recently been
published on the subject of forgery and fabricated
documents.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> One chapter is devoted to the subject of
forged literary autographs, but those who desire to
acquire an expert knowledge of this important question
should master the whole of its contents, and this
is no difficult task, for the volume only contains
seventy-seven pages. In proportion to the constant
rise in the value of autographs the temptation to
forgery increases, and the gradual absorption of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
genuine specimens is sure to bring into existence
a number of shams. As the authors very rightly
point out, "It is not surprising the profitable and
growing autograph market should have attracted
the fraudulent, for the prizes when won are generally
of a substantial character, and amply repay the misapplied
effort and ingenuity demanded. The success
which has attended too many of these frauds may be
largely accounted for by the fact that in many
cases the enthusiasm of the collector has outrun his
caution."</p>

<p>The letters of Washington, Franklin, Burns,
Nelson, Byron, Keats, Shelley, and Scott were the
first to attract the attention of the autograph forger
in England. Thackeray and Dickens have been
recently the object of his unwelcome attentions.
Most of the Thackeray forgeries, like the example
reproduced, are the work of one man, who uses an
ordinary pen and has a fondness for half-sheets of
paper. His feeble attempts to imitate Thackeray's
wit and style are alone sufficient to excite suspicion.
If the counterfeit is carefully compared with a
genuine specimen like the one given, deception will
be impossible. I possess a small collection of forged
autograph letters to use for detective purposes, and
as a warning to others. There are five of these
"duffer" Thackerays amongst them. The forger
apparently finds the upright hand Thackeray
adopted later in life more to his taste than the
less angular calligraphy of his youth. A few years
ago the London autograph market was inundated
with forged letters of Thackeray and Dickens. At
present they are kept out of the light of day, and
sold to the unwary in all sorts of out-of-the-way
places, often in shops at the sea-side. The Dickens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
forgeries are generally betrayed by the printed
address at the top of the letter being lithographed
and not embossed. The gentleman to whom
Dickens is said to have addressed his last letter
is supposed to have had a certain number of
facsimiles made for distribution amongst his friends.
These are now used occasionally like the Galignani-Byron
or the Churchill-Nelson. It is here a clear
case of <i>caveat emptor</i>.</p>

<p>Very often a letter is offered for sale which is in
no sense of the word a forgery, but which was never
written by the person the buyer supposes. In nine
cases out of ten the seller is as ignorant of the true
state of the case as the buyer. I allude to letters
written by persons bearing the same name, but whose
autographs possess a very different value. In addition
to the kings and queens whose names are identical,
we have two Oliver Cromwells, two Horace Walpoles,
two Sarah Siddonses, two Charles Dickenses, and
many other "doubles." I have within the last few
months seen a letter of the less-known Horace
Walpole catalogued as one of the owner of Strawberry
Hill, and a letter of Sarah Siddons the younger,
whose usual signature is "S. M. Siddons," described
as a "long and pleasing" specimen in the handwriting
of her mother. In these cases there is no sort of
resemblance in the calligraphy of the two persons.
The error arises solely from the similarity of the
name, and a lack of care or knowledge on the part of
the cataloguer. As a matter of fact, the letter of
Sarah Martha Siddons is an exceedingly interesting
one, and was written about two years before her
death under the tragic circumstances graphically
described by Mr. Knapp in his "Artist's Love Story."
I never saw any other letter of Sarah M. Siddons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
and I give it <i>in extenso</i> to show how careful one
should be in studying an autograph before purchasing
it. It should be remembered that "Sally"
Siddons promised her younger sister Maria, who died
in 1798 at Bristol Hot Wells "all for the love" of
the handsome painter, that under no circumstances
would she ever marry him. The letter gives a
striking picture of the Kemble-Siddons "circle" at
Bath in the first year of the nineteenth century.</p>

<i><span class="smcap">Bath</span>, July 19, 1801.</i>
</p>

<p>Indeed my dear Patty I am extremely concerned to hear
of your mother's serious illness which you may believe is not
a little augmented by the necessity I cannot but feel there is,
for your staying with her if she does not soon get the better
of this alarming attack, but you know my dear I am by nature
(<i>and heartily do I thank nature for it</i>) dispos'd to see the fairest
side of things, and I am flattering myself with the hopes that
your next letter will bring me good tidings, and that I shall
see my dear Patty arrive with my Mother<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> at Bath in less
now than a fortnight. Heaven be prais'd, <i>if I should but be
well</i> to receive you both, it will be one of the happiest days
of my life. Did I tell you how sociable we all were while my
uncle and Mrs. Kemble<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> were in Bath? dining every day
together, either at our own or the Twiss's house. I never saw
my Uncle so cheerful and like other people, and she was
quite agreeable and did not overwhelm us with Lords, Ladies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
Balls and Suppers. Mrs. Twiss<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> too is become quite kind,
nay <i>affectionate</i> to me <i>since I got well</i>, but <i>one smile, one tender
word, or attention</i> has more effect on me when I am ill and
miserable than all the kindness and attention I can meet
with, when I am well, and able (at least in some degree) to
return pleasure for pleasure. I have heard Betty Sharp sing
several times, and think she is very much improved in manner
and I hope her voice will improve in power, at present it is
often too weak to have much effect in a large room, crowded
with people. She is good humour'd and unaffected as far as
I have seen her, and her person as I told you before improv'd
most astonishingly. While my uncle and Mrs. Kemble were
here, we spent an evening at Mrs. Palmer's<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> which was
rather dull, and one at Miss Lee's<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> which was a little better.
I am sure they both would have been very tiresome to me
if it had not been for <i>my own people</i>. Pray remember me
very kindly to poor Mrs. Wilkinson, who is I hope recovering
every day&mdash;and to your friend Miss Brook. I should like to
see Cora in all her glory. I present by you a salute to her
Ladyship's divine parts. George<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> will still be with us when
you come. Cecy<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> will be gone to school and it is almost
time she should, for she is got so riotous nobody can manage
her when I am not in the way, for Patty is too good natured
... and tho' she continually threatens to tell me, she never
does and Cecilia knows she never will. Adieu my dear girl.
I shall hear from you surely in a day or two, till when, I

<p>Of the forged letters in my private "pillory" that
of Keats is by far the most cleverly executed. The
facsimiles of Byron and Nelson were never intended
to be used for the purposes of deception. The Keats
and Thackeray counterfeits, on the other hand, are
the work of a professional fabricator of spurious
autographs. In the Keats letters (dated Wentworth
Place, Hampstead, December 8, 1818) the postmarks,
the creases, the faded colour of the paper, and the
seal with the clasped hands and motto are all carefully
imitated, but it would not for a moment deceive
an experienced hand. Collectors should carefully
examine all Keats letters offered for sale&mdash;particularly
those addressed to "My dear Woodhouse."
The same remark applies to correspondence by
Burns, Scott, Shelley, and Byron, for those much-prized
and eagerly-sought-after letters have been
each in turn the subject of ingenious and carefully
prepared forgeries. The Byron forger (who claimed
relationship with the poet) escaped the punishment
he richly merited, but the wholesale manufacturer
of Burns and Scott MSS. was sent to jail for a
twelvemonth.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary case in the annals of
autograph forgery occurred in France&mdash;the country
<i>par excellence</i> of cunningly devised facsimiles&mdash;on
the eve of the Franco-Prussian War. It is
known as the <i>Affaire Vrain-Lucas</i>, and an excellent
account of it was published at the time
by M. Étienne Charavay.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Vrain-Lucas was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
needy adventurer; Michel Chasles was a scientist
of European reputation. Incredible as it may
appear, Vrain-Lucas, in the course of a few years,
induced one Chasles to purchase from him at the
aggregate price of about £6,000 no less than 27,000
autographs, nearly the whole of which were forgeries
of the most audacious description. Vrain-Lucas
bestowed on his counterfeits little of the care and
attention to detail which characterises some of the
Keats, Byron, Shelley, and Scott forgeries. Beginning
with a supposed correspondence between the
youthful Newton and Pascal, which Sir David
Brewster proved conclusively to be impossible, he
proceeded to fabricate letters of Rabelais, Montesquieu,
and La Bruyère. Before he had finished
M. Chasles became the possessor of letters <i>in
French</i> and written on <i>paper made in France</i> of
Julius Cæsar, Cleopatra, Mary Magdalene, and
even of Lazarus, after his resurrection. On February
16, 1870, Vrain-Lucas was brought before
a Paris Criminal Court (<i>Tribunal Correctionnel</i>).
Amongst the forged MSS. produced on behalf of
the prosecution were 5 letters of Abélard, 5 from
Alcibiades to Pericles, 181 of Alcuin, 1 of Attila
to a Gallic general, 6 of Alexander the Great
to Aristotle, to say nothing of examples of the
private correspondence of Herod, Pompey, Charles
Martel, Judas Iscariot, Mary Magdalene, Sapho,
Pontius Pilate, and Joan of Arc. Another long
alphabetical list of these fictitious <i>rariora</i> began
with Agnès Sorel, Anacreon, and the Emperor
Adrian, and ended with St. Theresa, Tiberius,
Turenne, and Voltaire.</p>

<p>Here is a delicious example of this farrago of
transparent fraud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span></p>


<p class='center'><i>Letter of Queen Cleopatra to Julius Cæsar.</i></p>

amé le contentement que je ressens lorsque je me trouve près

<p>And next came a safe-conduct pass written by
Vercingetorix in favour of "the young Trogus Pompeus
on a secret mission to Julius Cæsar"! Vrain-Lucas
was promptly sentenced to two years' imprisonment
for fraud, together with a fine of 500 francs
and the costs of the trial. The only excuse for
M. Michel Chasles, mathematician of renown and
Member of the Academy of Sciences, is to be found
in his numerous preoccupations and advanced age.
He was seventy-six in 1870.</p>

<p>In England the <i>Affaire Vrain-Lucas</i> has to some
extent its counterpart in the literary forgery carried
out with consummate skill by Dr. Constantine
Simonides, who managed to deceive that too ardent
collector, Sir Thomas Phillipps, with such tempting
rarities from a monastery on Mount Athos as part
of the original Gospel of St. Matthew, the Proverbs
of Pythagoras, or a copy of Homer written
on serpent's skin. But enough has been said of
these literary frauds.</p>

<p>There is, however, one more class of forged autographs.
I refer to letters fabricated in order to
injure another, or in furtherance of some political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
object. The Parnell letters, forged twenty years
ago by Richard Pigott, belonged to this class, but
they raised many of the questions which belong to
forgeries of autographs. I was lately shown a
forged letter of Napoleon III., supposed to have
been written in 1848, which had evidently been
fabricated many years later, possibly in 1865, in
order to discredit him when the Second Empire
began to lose its popularity. According to the
document he had ordered the assassination of some
associate suspected of treason. Not only was the
imitation of the calligraphy of Napoleon III. faulty
in many respects, but the signature, "Napoleon Bonaparte,"
at once betrayed the falsity of the document.
It was, curiously enough, enclosed in an official envelope
of Prince Jérôme Bonaparte's addressed to
Jules Favre!</p>

<p>The best-known dealers in autographs always
guarantee what they sell, and will readily take back
any doubtful specimen. In the early stage of
autograph collecting it is a manifest advantage to
confine one's transactions to men of this class.
Whenever the origin of an autograph is suspicious
or mysterious, it is always safest to obtain expert
opinion. As M. Charavay points out in dealing
with the <i>Affaire Vrain-Lucas</i>, the question of the
source from which an article comes is often of
capital importance. Never omit to read carefully
any given letter, and consider it from an historical
point of view, as well as a mere specimen of handwriting.
If M. Michel Chasles had done this he
would have saved his 140,000 francs. If the first
Newton letter he purchased had been submitted
to the historical test, he would have discovered
that at the time the philosopher was supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
discuss problems of the greatest abstruseness he
was only three years old. It was on this deal
that Vrain-Lucas built up his mountain of successful
fraud. Bear in mind all that has been
said of watermarks, postmarks, the shape and
quality of paper, &amp;c. Avoid notes written on scraps
of paper and ragged half-sheets. If you suspect
a letter to be a facsimile of some sort, touch the
writing gently with diluted muriatic acid. Forgeries
effected by the use of water-colour paint
yield at once to the application of hot water. As
yet the application of the useful maxim of <i>caveat
emptor</i> is only necessary in the case of comparatively
rare autographs. Letters of no great intrinsic
value have as yet not proved remunerative to the
forger, but it by no means follows that this will
always remain so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> autograph collecting is, as Mr. Joline defines it,
"one of the gentlest of emotions," it certainly gives
its votaries occasional moments of harmless excitement.
Many of my readers will doubtless remember
the faded handwriting on the battledores of our
childhood, which, it may be presumed, represented
the periodical clearings-out of lawyers' offices; but it
requires a considerable stretch of the imagination to
credit the presence of a portion of one of the copies
of the Magna Charta on a drum-head, although the
anecdote finds its place in all autograph handbooks.
Ample evidence, however, exists of the strong natural
affinity which once existed between ancient documents
and the callings of the grocer and the
fishmonger, but the use for old paper in this
connection has almost entirely gone out of fashion,
and the greater part of the discarded MSS. go
straight to the pulp-mills for the purposes of
reconversion. I will not attempt to disguise my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
envy of the pleasurable sensations Dr. Raffles must
have experienced when he picked up the original
account of the expenses incurred at the execution
of Mary Queen of Scots, duly attested by Burleigh,
for eighteenpence at a book-stall on Holborn Hill.
Almost equally lucky was the discoverer, on a printing-house
file at Wrexham, of the MS. of Bishop Heber's
famous missionary hymn, which not very long ago
fetched forty guineas at Sotheby's; and still more
so the traveller who reclaimed the whole of the
forty years' correspondence between James Boswell
and the Rev. W. J. Temple from the proprietor of a
Boulogne fish-shop.</p>

<p>As the value of autographs becomes more and
more widely known, and the search for them
becomes keener, chances of important "finds"
become rarer, but the possibilities of this kind of
treasure-trove are by no means exhausted. English
MSS. of great interest and value continually come
to light abroad. Letters of the early Reformers
often turn up in Holland. Hooper, Bishop of
Gloucester, sent the whole of his MSS. to his friend
Bullinger, and as yet only a single letter of Tyndall
has ever come to light. Others, in all human probability,
are hidden away in the <i>bahuts</i> and presses of
the Low Countries, where letters of the Duke of
Marlborough are not unfrequently offered for sale.
Fine Stuart autographs constantly turn up both in
Germany and Rome. It was in the Eternal City
that the priceless MSS. of Cardinal York were
offered for sale at the modest price of £20. The
English collector <i>cannot too carefully examine the
catalogues regularly issued by foreign dealers</i>. I have
already alluded to my discovery of the marriage
settlement of Pamela FitzGerald and the sixteenth-century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
deed relating to a French commission for the
colonisation of Canada. It was in a Paris price-list
that I came across the following extraordinary letter
of Sir Humphry Davy on the subject of his quarrel
with George Stephenson:&mdash;</p>


<p class='center'><i>Sir Humphry Davy to John Buddle, Esq., Wallsend, Newcastle.</i></p>

<i><span class="smcap">London</span>, February 8, 1817.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Newman appears dilatory and has not yet
made the apparatus to my mind; but I hope soon to send
it you and to give you your <i>new right</i>. I hope no one will try
expts with platinum in explosive atmospheres till my paper
is published for if <i>fine wire</i> is used and suffered to <i>hang out</i>
of the lamp so as to ignite to whiteness in the <i>external</i> air
explosion will follow; but by the most simple precaution
security is absolute. Stevenson's Pamphlet has proved to the
satisfaction of every person who has looked at it in London,
that he <i>endeavoured</i> to steal from what he had heard of my
researches, safety tubes and apertures: no one could have
established his piracy so effectively as himself.</p>

<p>It is stated in one of these malignant advertisements which
are below my contempt that I was in the coal district in the
end of September 1815. Whereas I left it two days after I
saw you at Wallsend which I think was the 23rd or 24th of
August and went to Bishop Auckland where I stayed only
three days and I spent the greater part of the month of
September with Lord Harewood and was in London working
in my Laboratory early in October and had discovered several
apertures and tubes in the middle of last month whilst Mr.
Stevenson's absurd idea of <i>admitting Hydrogen</i> in undetached
portions by a slider was fermenting in his mind. I certainly
never thought of employing <i>capilliary</i> [<i>sic</i>] tubes. My tubes
were merely <i>safe</i> tubes for I knew perfectly well and have
proved by expts that no lamp could be fed on air through real
capilliary tubes. To make a lamp that will burn on three
capilliary tubes is as impossible as to make it burn in a closed
decanter. Stevenson's capilliary tubes are evidently stolen
from what Mr. Hodgson communicated early in November
of my small safe tubes and made capilliary to suit Mr. Brandlings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>

a private purloiner. One may attempt to murder while the

ashamed of such friends as Aladdin and Fair play, at least he
cannot wish to be seen in public with them even though he
should love them as dearly as <i>himself</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. George Stevenson has changed his note from capilliary
tubes to small tubes. No one can doubt that he pilfered
these from Mr. Hodgson's communication of Sir H. Davy's
discoveries. His original principle to admit Hydrogen in
small detached portions (detached by a slider) is now kept
out of sight. A man who in the face of the whole world and
in open day light steals the <i>safety trimmer</i> and a safe <i>top</i> in
Killingworth Colliery and in the dark may endeavour to steal
safety apertures and tubes. But does he now know what is a
safe aperture? Let those people who use his lamp, his capilliary
tube lamp, look to themselves.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a country house or muniment-room
in England which may not afford a happy
hunting-ground to the collector. It is only quite
lately missing originals of the Paston Letters (lost
ever since 1789) were recovered in the library of the
descendants of Pitt's friend and literary executor,
Bishop Pretyman-Tomline. Although Moore, Murray,
and Hobhouse burned one copy of Byron's MS.
autobiography in 1824, a duplicate is supposed to be
in existence, but its present whereabouts is unknown.
In a quiet corner of the Harcourt Library at Nuneham,
Whitelock's MS. was found quite unexpectedly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
Burckhardt's journal of the Euphrates Expedition of
1811, and the MSS. of William Oldys are still
missing. A bundle of genuine Keats letters was
disinterred at Melbourne, and the letters of the Rev.
George Crabbe to Miss Elizabeth Charter, now in
my possession, sojourned for many years in the
Antipodes.</p>

<p>Within the last half-century letters of Addison,
Prior, and Mordaunt Earl of Peterborough, and
other MSS. of great value, were saved from
imminent destruction in a manor house, near
Llangollen.</p>

<p>It was only seventy years ago that a dealer in
Hungerford Market, named Jay, purchased at £7 a
ton a large accumulation of "waste-paper" from
the Somerset House authorities. By the merest
accident it transpired that amongst the MSS. thus
unceremoniously treated were Exchequer Office
Accounts of the reign of Henry VII., Secret
Service Accounts signed by Eleanor Gwynne, and
Wardrobe Accounts of Queen Elizabeth. Several
bundles of parchments were sold by Jay to a Fleet
Street confectioner, and turned into jelly, before any
suspicion arose as to their possible value or importance.
It was seventeen years later than this, in 1857,
that three hundred tons of papers, including the records
of the Indian Navy, went from the old India
House to the paper-mill. Comparatively few of
the Jay MSS. were recovered, for three tons of
paper which remained untouched were accidentally
burned.</p>

<p>There is no more picturesque incident in the
annals of literary discovery than Sir H. Maxwell
Lyle's account of his "find" in a loft at Belvoir, the
clue to which was afforded by a faded label on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
rusty key. "The disturbance of the surface," we
are told, "caused a horrible stench, and it soon
became evident that the loft had been tenanted by
rats, who had done lasting damage to valuable MSS.
by gnawing and staining them. Some documents
had been reduced to powder, others had lost their
dates or their signatures. The entire centre of a
long letter in the hand of Robert Dudley, Earl of
Leicester, had entirely disappeared. Those that
remained were of a very varied character. A deed
of the time of Henry II. was found among some
granary accounts of the eighteenth century, and
gossiping letters of the Court of Elizabeth among
modern vouchers. Letters to Henry Vernon of
Haddon from the Duke of Clarence, the Earl of
Warwick, and Kings Edward IV., Richard III., and
Henry VII., written on paper and folded very small,
lay hidden between large leases engrossed on thick
parchment."</p>

<p>The loft at Belvoir is certainly not the only place
in the United Kingdom where autographic treasure-trove
lies hid, and no opportunity should be missed
of turning over collections of MSS., when the
occasion presents itself. Some five years ago an
entry in one of the catalogues of Mr. B. Dobell, of
77, Charing Cross Road, led me to become the
possessor of the holograph project for the Defence of
England drawn up in 1803-5 by General Dumouriez,
on behalf of the last Pitt Administration. The MS.
covers nearly four hundred pages, and is carefully
bound in white vellum. Every page of it is in
Dumouriez's handwriting. From first to last the
work done by Dumouriez cost the Government quite
£20,000. Only fragments of the scheme exist in the
archives of the War Office. This book contains the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><br /><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
project in its entirety. It cost me twenty-seven

collaboration with Dr. Holland Rose.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> I have certainly
been fortunate in acquiring a great many
unknown documents relating to Napoleon and the
Napoleonic wars. While rummaging amongst the
miscellaneous papers in the possession of Mr. George
Mackey, the well-known Birmingham antiquary, I
lighted on the whole correspondence between Lord
Cawdor and the Duke of Portland relating to the
landing in February, 1797, of the French "Black

<p>For some unaccountable reason the commonplace
book of the unofficial laureate of the Navy
had drifted to Birmingham. It was found by me
in the same bin of literary odds and ends as the
Cawdor dispatches, which obviously ought to have
been in the Home Office or the Record Office. At
the same time and place I lighted on the letters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
Colonel Digby, the "Mr. Fairly," of Fanny Burney's
Journal, to the beautiful sisters Margaret and Isabella
Gunning, the first of whom he afterwards married,
thereby (if the Court gossip of the day may be
trusted) sorely disappointing the literary Assistant-Keeper
of the Royal Robes.</p>

<p>It was from Mr. Dobell that I obtained another
of the MSS. in my collection which I specially prize&mdash;I
allude to the holograph copy of Mrs. Robinson's
"Memoirs," written nearly entirely on the covering
sheets of old letters upon which one reads the
signatures of such important and fashionable personages
as the Duke of Clarence, Duchesses of
Ancaster and Dorset, the Earl of Jersey, the
Marquis of Lothian, the Duke of Grafton, and so
forth. It is also curious to trace the frequent flittings
of the unfortunate "Perdita," the early love of
the Prince described in bitter irony as "the first
gentleman in Europe." From Berkeley Square she
moves to Clarges Street, and thence in rapid succession
to Piccadilly, Curzon Street, St. James's
Place, Hill Street, Stanhope Street, and South
Audley Street. Now she is at the Ship Inn at
Brighton; now at the Hôtel de Russie and the
Hôtel de Chartres at Paris; now at No. 10, North
Parade, Bath. One or two letters seem to have
been addressed to Englefield Cottage, where she
died. On an ivy-grown tomb in Old Windsor
churchyard one can still decipher Samuel Pratt's
lines beginning:&mdash;</p>

<p>By the kindness of Dr. Scott I added to my
collection a genuine letter of great Shakespearean
interest, for it is addressed to Edward Alleyn, the
Founder of Dulwich College, by William Wilson,
one of the actors in Shakespeare's troop at the
Fortune Theatre. It runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='center'>
To my most dear and especial good friend Mr. Edward<br />
Alleyn at Dulwich.<br />
</p>

<p>Right worshipful, my humble duty remembered hoping
in the Almighty that your health and prosperity, which on
my knees I beseech Him long to continue, for the many
favours which I have from time to time received. My poor
ability is not in the least degree able to give you satisfaction
unless as I and mine have been bound to you for your many
kindnesses so will we during life pray for your prosperity. I
confess I have found you my chiefest friend in the midst of
my extremities which makes me loth to press or request your
favour any further, yet for that I am to be married on Sunday
next and your kindness may be a great help and furtherance
unto me towards the raising of my poor and deserted estate I
am enforced once again to entreat your worship's furtherance
in a charitable request which is that I may have your worship's
letter to Mr. Dowton and Mr. Edward Juby to be a means
that the company of players of the Fortune [may] either offer
at my wedding at St. Saviour's Church or of their own good
nature bestow something upon me on that day and as ever I
and mine will not only rest bounden unto yourself but continually
pray for your worship's health with increase of all
happiness long to continue. I hope of your worship's favour
herein. I humbly take my leave. Resting your Worship's
during life to be commanded</p>

<p class='right'>
<span class="mr2 smcap">William Wilson.</span>

<p>From the registers of St. Saviour's, Southwark,
it is clear that Wilson's marriage took place there on
<i>Sunday</i>, November 2, 1617, about eighteen months
after Shakespeare's death. Dowton, like Farren, is
an hereditary theatrical name, and the Wilson letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
reveals another actor Dowton, probably an ancestor
of the Dowtons of a later time. Dr. Wallace, the
erudite discoverer of the new Shakespeare document
at the Record Office, writes me that he considers the
letter of William Wilson an excellent specimen of
the epistolary style of Shakespeare's time, and of
singular interest to Shakespearean students.</p>

<p>Some of my most interesting "finds" are now
placed in my Napoleonic collection, which I have
almost doubled in extent since the publication of
"Collectanea Napoleonica."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> For £5 I obtained, some
five years ago at Sotheby's, the letter of 24 4to
pages in which Sir Stamford Raffles describes his
visit to St. Helena and his interview with Napoleon.
As I received a very substantial sum for permission
to reproduce a portion of it in a daily paper, this
interesting and valuable MS. cost me nothing. At
the Bunbury sale a great many letters of historical
importance fetched a comparatively low price. It
was at this sale that Mr. Frank Sabin bought the
second and more lengthy letter from George Crabbe
to Edmund Burke now in my possession. It was at
the Bunbury "dispersal" that the late Mr. Frederick
Barker bought for me the extraordinary official letter
and holograph proclamation to the Vendéans penned
by Louis Larochejaquelein on June 2, 1815, an hour
or two before his death. These documents would
certainly have fetched five times the price I paid
for them in Paris, where I had to pay £10 for a
letter of his more famous brother Henry, killed in
1794. I also purchased at the Bunbury sale two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
long letters of C. J. Fox to his uncle, General Fox,
and a confidential letter of Earl Bathurst giving
Bunbury his opinion of Gourgaud, and enclosing
four sheets of a private letter from Sir Hudson
Lowe. The companionship of autographs is curious.
In a letter of the Marquis Montchenu, the garrulous
French Commissioner at St. Helena, I found an
autograph of Sir Hudson Lowe, written in 1780 at
the London Inn, Exeter, when he was a boy-ensign
in the Devon Militia! It was Montchenu who
caused a sensation at the Courts of the Allied
Powers by declaring that Lowe was about to make
Napoleon the godfather of his son, who in 1857 was
one of the garrison in the Lucknow Residence.
In June, 1906, M. Noël Charavay bought for me at
the Dablin sale a number of Napoleonic <i>rariora</i>,
amongst them the Longwood Household Expenses
Book kept by Pierron, the <i>maître d'hôtel</i>, between
March, 1818, and April 30, 1821. The entries are
always countersigned by Montholon, and in many
cases are controlled by Napoleon, who frequently
made calculations as to the relative value of pounds
and shillings in francs. All these papers will, doubtless,
be useful to some one who desires to say the
last word on the Last Phase, and I am very grateful
to Mr. Frank Sabin, who procured for me the original
copy of the elaborately-bound "Last Reign of
Napoleon," which Mr. J. C. Hobhouse, afterwards
Lord Broughton, sent out to Sir Hudson Lowe for
presentation to Napoleon, but which was never given
to him. On the flyleaf the author copied out a
suggestive quotation from Tacitus. The romance
of these volumes belongs rather to the subject of
extra-illustration, which I hope to deal with in a
future work. I have already pointed out the utility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
of this interesting pursuit for the proper preservation
of valuable autographs. In America, where so many
collectors believe that "the political is ephemeral
and the literary eternal," thousands of autographs
are inserted in as many books, to which the special
charm and value of "association" is thus given.
I need not say that I have placed a characteristic
John Cam Hobhouse letter in the second volume of
this unique copy of "The Last Reign of Napoleon."
Some two years since I obtained through Messrs.
Maggs, of 109, Strand, two very interesting MSS.
connected with the Irish Rebellion of 1798. One
of these is the Camolin Cavalry Detail Book,
May 25-October 8, 1798, and the other is made
up of a collection of the letters written between
1796 and 1815 by Arthur, Earl of Mount Norris, a
Royalist leader. With the new light obtained from
them and the MS. journal of a lady who was an eye-witness
of the occurrences she describes, Mr. H. F. B.
Wheeler and the writer have endeavoured to again
deal with the story of the "War in Wexford." I have
by no means completed my list of "finds." I trust,
however, I have said enough to illustrate the utility
of autograph-hunting and the pleasurable excitement
derivable from the unexpected running to earth of
some long-since forgotten letter or document which
is not only of money value, but can help to throw
new light either on the life of the writer, or the far-off
times in which it was written.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> autographs of Royalty have, for more than a
century, formed a favourite subject for collection,
not only in the United Kingdom, but on the Continent
and in the United States, where I am told
the finest examples of this fascinating branch of
the autograph cult (Mr. Adrian Joline calls it frankly
a hobby) are to be found. Royal letters and signatures
figure conspicuously and plentifully in all books
of facsimiles, but the young collector would do well
to study carefully two volumes devoted exclusively to
this particular branch of calligraphy.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Examples of
Royal handwriting abound in both the Record Office
and the British Museum, although a good many were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
either turned into jelly, burned, or otherwise wasted
in consequence of such regrettable transactions as the
"waste-paper" deals between the officials of Somerset
House and Mr. Jay, and those of the new India Office
and the pulping-mills.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> It is clear that Royal autographs
may be looked for in all sorts of out-of-the-way
and unexpected places. Henry VIII.'s love-letters
to Anne Boleyn are said to be hidden away in
the Vatican, and Sir H. Maxwell Lyte found the
sign manuals of monarchs amongst the débris of the
Belvoir hay-loft.</p>

<p>In no class of autographs is the rise of prices and
increase of value so remarkable as in those now under
discussion. I cannot precisely ascertain the present
worth of the signature of Richard II., with whom
the English series is supposed to commence, but
M. Noël Charavay tells me that a document signed
by John II., the first of the French Royal signers,
would fetch £10. Before me lie some interesting
details as to the value of Royal autographs in 1827,
and a group of catalogues, containing a good many
desirable items of this kind, issued in London between
1875 and 1885.</p>

<p>It will be instructive to note the prices which
choice specimens fetched at these comparatively
recent periods. In <i>The Archivist</i> of December, 1889,
we are informed that according to the price-currents
of 1827 the autographs of "Elizabeth the adored of her
people" are worth £2 2s., while Charles I., "worshipped
as a martyr," commands the same price. Charles
II., with his Queen, Catharine of Braganza, thrown
in, fetches no more than £1 5s. James II. is worth
£3 8s., owing to a limited supply. William III.
yields less than half that figure, but a whole letter
of Queen Mary was knocked down for £3 10s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter w375px">
<img src="images/page_119.jpg" width="375" height="456" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class='center'>A.L.S. OF KING GEORGE III. ON THE SUBJECT OF THE DEFENCE
OF ENGLAND IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE GREAT TERROR OF
1796-1805.</p>

<p class='center'>(By permission of Mr. John Lane.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The expert of this excellent journal continues:
"George I., 'a heavy, dull German gentleman,' is
reckoned worth only £1 1s., and George II., I am
ashamed to say it, only 14s. Our beloved monarch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
George III., being well remembered, rises to £3 10s.
George IV., the most complete gentleman of his
age,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> rises above all his Royal predecessors and
reaches £4 14s. 6d.; it is also curious to see how so
great a king and so fine a gentleman wrote when he
was a boy and to possess a leaf of his copybook.
Here I fain would conclude this estimate of British
rulers, but truth compels me to add that Oliver
Cromwell is deemed worth £5 15s. 6d. French
kings are sadly degraded. Five <i>Grands Monarques</i>,
among whom are Francis I. and Louis XIV., are
estimated at the average price of 4s. 1½d. each;
Henry IV. advanced to 14s., but Napoleon, in the very
teeth of French legitimacy, reaches 20s. higher. A
French Queen, Anne of Austria, is worth 7s., while
Josephine, the shadow of a French empress, is worth
more than five times this sum. A great and wise
Emperor of Russia, and the brave King of Prussia,
require the aid of a French prince, an English
princess, and seven English peers to push them up to
16s." These were indeed halcyon days for the
collectors, but at that period they were few and far
between. Mr. William Upcott, the <i>doyen</i> of modern
autograph collectors, reigned almost supreme at
"Autograph Cottage," Islington, his only possible
competitors being Mr. Young and Mr. John Dillon.</p>

<p>In the mid "eighteen-seventies" Mr. John Waller,
the conscript father of London autograph-dealers,
was about to move from 58, Fleet Street to Harley
House, Artesian Road, Westbourne Grove. A little
later the late Mr. Frederick Barker began to issue
catalogues of autograph letters and historical documents
from Rowan Road, Brook Green. He became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
the agent of Mr. William Evarts Benjamin, now the
<i>doyen</i> of the autograph merchants in New York, then
residing at 744, Broadway. In Mr. Waller's first catalogues
I find the following "Royalties": Charles II.
Royal Sign Manual, 7s. 6d.; letter from Charles II.
of Spain to William III., 4s. 6d.; George Sign
Manual when blind, 7s. 6d.; George I. Sign Manual,
1 p. folio, 12s. 6d.; Henry II. of France, fine D.S.
with State seal, 12s. 6d.; King of Siam, 7s. 6d.;
Papal Bull of Urban VIII., 30s.; Warrant of Privy
Council of Edward VI. with numerous rare signatures,
25s.; Duke of Sussex, interesting letter on the
trial of Queen Caroline, 4s. 6d.; Queen Victoria, two
Royal Sign Manuals at 10s. each; Henry VIII.
Royal Sign Manual on "vellum, document of great
beauty," 48s.; Henry VII. Royal Sign Manual on
"document of greatest interest," 70s.; Frederick
Prince of Wales, L.S., 10s.; Charles I. when Prince
of Wales, D.S., 34s.; Louis XVI. and Marie
Antoinette&mdash;signatures on two "important documents,"
24s. the pair; Napoleon I. L.S. 2 pp. 4to
to Prince of Neuchatel, Valladolid, January 11, 1809,
25s.; Papal Bull Alexander III., 1181, 47s. 6d.;
Mary II. Royal Sign Manual, 30s.; Original Orders
for Arrest of Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III.),
June 13, 1848, 52s. 6d.; Napoleon II. (King of
Rome), 4 pp. of an original historical essay, 48s.;
Royal Sign Manual of Philip and Mary, ten guineas;
A.L.S. of Charles II., 1½ pp., Whitehall, September
26, 1660, <i>à sa chère s&#339;ur</i>, 73s. 6d. I will not
pursue this list further. The reader can judge of
the relative value of Royal autographs in 1827
and 1875-80.</p>

<p>In the price of the autographs of sovereigns of
minor importance there has been no striking rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
since 1880. Indeed, I note that on December 17th,
1909, letters and documents signed by Ferdinand,
Grand Duke of Tuscany, Louis XVIII. of France,
Mathias de Medicis, also of Tuscany, and Rudolph II.,
Emperor of Germany, were knocked down in one
lot at Sotheby's for five shillings. But letters of
the Tudor and Stuart sovereigns are fetching as
many pounds in 1910 as they did shillings eighty
years ago. A pardon granted by James II. to
Edward Strode, of Downside, "on account of his
entertaining the Duke of Monmouth for one night
immediately after his defeat at Sedgemoor," sold
on December 17, 1909, for £57. Mr. Waller in
1876 would assuredly have catalogued it at 57s.
or less. Four years ago I purchased for Sir George
White, Bart., of Bristol, an order, signed by the
same sovereign, enjoining the Duke of Beaufort to
burn Keynsham Bridge on the approach of Monmouth
and his followers, at the modest price of
42s. Amongst other letters or documents belonging
to this category figuring in the last sale of 1909 may
be mentioned a letter signed by Cromwell addressed
to the Genevan Senate on the recent Protestant
massacres in the Alps (July 28, 1655), for which
Mr. Sabin gave £31, and two A.L.S.&mdash;one of George
IV. and one of William IV., which went to Mr. W. V.
Daniell for 12s. To what indignation would this
startling fall in value have moved the righteous soul
of the chronicler of the sale-prices of 1827! MSS. of
"The First Gentleman in Europe" rank no longer
amongst the high-priced autographs, but I shall have
more to say of them presently. Experience has

in the matter of seventeenth-century Stuart letters.
At Munich I quite lately came across a fine A.L.S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
of Charles I. for £10, and a delightful L.S.
of his eldest son while in exile to the Elector
Palatine, with seals and silken cords intact, for 50s.
Good William III. letters now average £10, but I
obtained the following characteristic letter written
from the Camp before Namur for less than half
that sum:&mdash;</p>

<p>Letters of Frederick the Great, be they holograph
or merely signed, are cheaper in England than on the
Continent. Even the L.S. are often witty, and I
have met with many good specimens at from 10s.
to 15s. One of the greatest treasures in my collection
is a superb letter of the Empress Catharine II. of
Russia, dated July 28, 1767, and addressed to
Madame de Bielke, of Hamburg, who gave it to a
Foreign Office official, Sir Charles Flint, from whose
descendant it passed into my possession. It was
submitted by M. Noël Charavay<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> to M. Rambaud,
ex-Minister of Public Instruction, Professor at the
Sorbonne, who discovered it to be one of an important
series, of which sixteen are published in the
"Collection de la Société impériale d'histoire de
Russie." Sir Charles Flint was an early collector of
autographs, and his duties as a King's Messenger
gave him excellent opportunities of picking up
treasures like this. I think it best to give the letter
in the original French, instead of following the
modernised version adopted in Paris:&mdash;</p>

l'Europe dont vous me faite part quelque fois je vous en
conterés d'Asie, j'ai fait 1300 Werstes sur le Volga j'ai
descendu dans les endroits les plus remarquables, j'ai trouvé
les deux bords du Volga d'une beauté au dessus presque de
l'expression, peuplés et cultivés tres honetement, mais
l'endroit qui a le plus attiré mon attention est sans contredit
la ville de Casan; au premier coup d'&#339;il l'on voit que s'est la
capitale d'un grand Royaume; j'y ai trouvé des habitans de
huit nations aussi differentes par leur habillement que par
leurs m&#339;urs, Religions, languages, et idées, cette Ville est
tres opulente et s'est la premiere des nôtres qui a recon&#772;u que
les batimens de bois sont moins bons que ceux de pierres, qui
peut, en fait a present de cette derniere espeçe, et ceux qui
n'ont pas euë cette facultés ont euë le malheur de perdre les

la ville brulée mais en verité l'on ne s'en aperçevoit pas, tant
cette ville est grande, je fais rebatir la moitié brulés en pierre
et probablement ce sera un quartier très hon&#772;ete, la Ville m'a
don&#772;é une mascarade un souper un feu d'artifiçe et une fete

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;It is now six weeks since I returned from my
long journey, and during this time I have been scarcely able
to find a moment in which to reply to you, although I said to
myself daily, "I will write to-morrow"; but, when the
morrow came, I experienced the same trouble as on the
previous day, and in the end I was so tired that I might well
have exclaimed with "The Married Philosopher,"<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> "I have
thought so much that I have no thoughts left." Meanwhile I
have to answer five letters of your own, all of which breathe
a general desire on your part to be of some service to me. I
am, indeed, obliged to you for this, Madam, wherein I readily
discern that lovable disposition which has ever been one of
your distinguishing traits.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
<p>In return for the European news which you communicate
to me from time to time, here is news from Asia. I did 1,300
versts on the Volga, landing at the most notable spots. I
found both banks of the Volga beautiful almost beyond
expression, and withal fairly populated and cultivated. But
the spot which attracted most attention on my part is unquestionably
the City of Kazan.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> You recognise at first sight
that you are here in the capital of a great kingdom. I found
there members of eight nationalities, all equally distinct in
dress, customs, religion, language, and modes of thought.
The city is very prosperous, and the first of our towns to
recognise that wooden are inferior to stone buildings. All
who can afford it, now build houses of the latter type, and
those who were precluded from doing so had the misfortune
of seeing their homes wrecked in a conflagration which
occurred some two years since. But as a matter of fact, we
never noticed this, as the city is so vast. I am having the
ruined half of the city rebuilt in stone, and it will probably
present a very respectable appearance. The city authorities
entertained me to a masque, a supper, fireworks, while for the
people there was held a public festival, at which each nation
danced in its own peculiar style in front of the house in which
I was staying. There was a great influx of the nobility of
the neighbourhood, so that the masks of both sexes belonging
to this order numbered no fewer than four hundred.
Apart from all this, I came across fine factories, and goods of
all descriptions. For my entry, they had erected a triumphal
arch such as I had never yet beheld at any solemnity.
Finally, when seven days had elapsed, I left with some
diffidence this town whose only fault is that it is situated
in Asia, and distant from here by some 800 versts. On
the other hand, its soil is most fruitful, wild asparagus,
cherries, apricots, and roses growing there like brushwood in
other lands. They heat their ovens with oak and lime-tree,
there being no other wood available. We found it excessively
hot there at the end of May, and their winter is shorter than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
our own. Thence I proceeded to the limits of the Kingdom of
Kazan, and the starting point of the boundaries of the
Astrakhan Kingdom. And here I came across the ruins of a
town built by Tamerlane for his grandson, of which all that
survives in its entirety are a couple of minarets built of freestone,
a mosque, and six vaulted chambers. The soil there is
as black as coal, and when you sow there is no need to till;
you need only pass lightly over the seeds with an instrument
used everywhere for that purpose, the name of which I have
forgotten. Following upon that, I returned here, covering
800 versts in six days, and feeling none the worse for it. I
only hope that your health is equally satisfactory, and that
you entertain no doubts as to my regard and friendship for
you.</p>

<p>Few Royal letters interest me more than those of
George III., upon whose worth of character, in my
opinion, they throw a strong light. Five years ago
they were comparatively rare, although Farmer George

his desk at all hours of the day and night from 1760
until his Jubilee in 1809, when blindness fell upon him,
and his signature became an undecipherable scrawl.
His writing was peculiarly neat and legible. Only
when under the influence of illness or strong emotion
did he omit to add the hour and minutes to the day
of the week and month. Here is an early letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>

<p>The finest letters of George III. from a moral and
patriotic point of view are unquestionably those
written during the "Great Terror," when for nearly
ten years the practical realisation of Napoleon's
threatened invasion of our shores was expected at
any moment. Some years ago, at the cost of £5,
I obtained the following letter addressed by the
King to Lord Mulgrave just four days before
Trafalgar:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'>
<i><span class="smcap">Kew</span>, October 17 1805</i></p>

<p>The information received by the mail just arrived is so
important that Lord Mulgrave has judged very properly in
instantly communicating it, though at an irregular hour. The
violence of Bonaparte is highly advantageous to the good
cause, and probably has affected a decision in the line to be
pursued by the King of Prussia that will be more efficacious
than the interview with the Emperor of Russia would have
produced without it.</p>

flooded the market. The average price fell
from £5 and more to £2 and less. Every autograph
dealer in London had a stock, so there could be no
"corner" in "Georges." I contrived to get thirty or
forty&mdash;mostly written from Weymouth. It seems
that during the great crisis King George wrote
almost daily to "Dear Frederic" (his son the Duke
of York, Commander-in-Chief), and many of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
letters are of the greatest interest. For 10s. I picked
up the King's holograph draft of a plan for mobilising
an army of defence between Dorchester and Weymouth.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Between 1789 and 1805 George III. paid
fourteen visits to Weymouth. Many momentous
acts of State were carried out at the Royal Lodge,
now transformed, with hardly any structural change,
into the Gloucester Hotel. If it had not been for
the death of the Duke of Gloucester, the King would
have received the news of Trafalgar in the same
place where he had talked a few weeks previously
with "Nelson's Hardy." Some day these letters will
help materially the telling of the story of the "Court
by the Sea." I thank Thackeray for the lines which
made George III., when old, blind, and forsaken,
say:&mdash;</p>

<p>The letters of the Princess of Wales (1796-1819),
the Queen Caroline of 1820-21, are not very valuable,
but they are curious.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> They are now quite as valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
as those of her worthless husband and his
successor, of whom I possess several interesting
examples, beginning in the days when he was sailing
with Digby and earning the sobriquet of "Jolly
Young Tarry-breeks." At the sale of the library of
the Princess Edward of Saxe-Weimar (June 21,
1904) I purchased three volumes, bound in green
calf, full of Prince William's early notes and exercises.
One of these is docketed by the youthful
sailor "Remarks on Countries, Harbours, Towns, etc.
on board the <i>Prince George</i>, Feb 8 1780 William
Henry." Some day my friends in the United States
will read a description of New York from the pen of
a future King of England, written a century and a
quarter ago, and the romantic story connected with
it. Here is a letter he wrote home to his tutor,
Dr. Majendie, from Sandy Hook. It speaks volumes,
at any rate, for his good intentions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I send you enclosed a key of a table of mine

me to draw.</p>

heartily wish you a quick passage, a sight of your family in
London, to whom I beg you will make my best wishes, thank
your Brother in my name for having collected the Poets for me.</p>

<p>The little I have seen of Captain Napier I like very well; I
hope he does the same of me; in the letters you allowed me
the pleasure to write pray give me such advice as you think
necessary I shall hope to receive it from nobody, but particularly
from you I have so long lived with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span></p>

<p>There is nothing more astonishing than the
manner in which the letters of the late Queen
Victoria have got into the autograph market on
either side of the Atlantic. Mr. Joline gives a very
startling instance of this, and I believe all her late
Majesty's correspondence with Mr. Gladstone went
to America, and that for a very inadequate consideration.
The examples I give of the writing of living
members of the Royal Family are only fragments
reproduced as specimens of calligraphy. I can never
quite understand how the Royal letters came to
figure in dealers' catalogues, notwithstanding in many
cases the confidential nature of their contents. In
his "Collections and Recollections" (1898) Mr.
George W. E. Russell gives the following autograph
anecdote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Like many other little boys, Prince Alexander of
Battenberg ran short of pocket-money and wrote an
ingenious letter to his august Grandmother, Queen
Victoria, asking for some slight pecuniary assistance.
He received in return a just rebuke, telling him that
little boys should keep within their limits and that
he must wait till his allowance next became due.
Shortly afterwards the undefeated little Prince
resumed the correspondence in something like the
following form: 'My dear Grandmama, I am sure
you will be glad to know that I need not trouble you
for any money just now, for I sold your last letter to
another boy here for thirty shillings.'"</p>

<p>Within the last few years the death of two or three
trusted couriers and upper servants accounts for the
sale of a great many papers of this kind, including
whole bundles of telegrams in the handwriting of their
employers. From a similar source came one of the
last letters Queen Victoria ever penned, and a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
touching relic it is, showing the care for others and
deep womanly sympathy which characterised the
whole of her life. I have since learned that it is
customary to retranscribe the originals of telegrams
penned by illustrious personages. If this is so the
practice is most reprehensible. The telegrams from
H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught to the late Queen
Victoria have nothing in them of a confidential character.
The first telegram is reproduced by permission

<p>The autograph of the late Prince Albert Victor
will some day become exceedingly rare and costly.
The only example I have of his writing is the
telegram he sent to his grandmother, Queen Victoria,
at Darmstadt, from that <i>caravanserai</i> of kings, the
Hôtel Bristol, in the Place Vendôme, Paris. It is
not often that Royalty honours one of those irritating
social tortures entitled "An Album of Confessions
to Record Thoughts and Feelings." The late Duke
of Coburg (Prince Alfred of England) fell a victim
to the possessor of one thirty-seven years ago, and
the results figured at the modest price of £1 in a
London catalogue:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Some years ago, when I first took up autograph
collecting as a serious occupation, I bought from Mr.
James Tregaskis, of the "Caxton Head," a copy-book
of George, Prince of Wales, filled up when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
was in his thirteenth year. Few boys of that age
could, in this twentieth century, emulate the copper-plate
of the then industrious Heir Apparent. With
the copybooks went his first cap and frock, both
edged with the daintiest Valenciennes lace. The
genuineness of these relics of Royalty was attested
by the Dowager Countess of Effingham, Lady-in-Waiting
to Queen Charlotte, and their subsequent
possessor, Mr. F. Madan, of the Bodleian Library. A
little later I purchased the Prince's "exercise-book"
of three years later, which begins with an "Extract
of the First Oration of Cicero against Catiline,
spoken before their Majesties in the Picture Gallery
at Windsor, August 12, 1778." At the same time
I acquired the Duke of York's "Translations from
Terence." On the first page, the student of fifteen
writes: "Frederick. This volume begun January 9th,
1778. <i>Dimidium facti, qui bene c&#339;pit, habet.</i>" It
is sad to think they were within measurable distance
of the "Perdita" entanglement of 1780-81. I was
already in a position to satisfy the curiosity of the
expert of 1827 as to a page of the copy-book, "of
the best king that ever lived," but some time later
I became the owner of a whole collection of Royal
letters relating to the early married life of Queen
Victoria and the Prince Consort, and the up-bringing
of their elder children. There was nothing of a
confidential nature in these MSS. Everything
tended to demonstrate the beauty and simplicity
of the home-life of the Sovereign at Windsor and
Buckingham Palace in the now far away "eighteen-forties,"
and the care bestowed on the up-bringing
of his late Majesty King Edward VII. These
documents formed the nucleus of a book, and by
the permission of Messrs. Harper &amp; Brothers several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
of them are now reproduced. The <i>édition de luxe</i>
of this book<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> has been extra-illustrated by two
ladies in New York. I have also treated a copy
very elaborately in this way, and I venture to think
it will make history some day. Many of the "unconsidered
trifles" it contains are not likely to be
soon met with again, and the <i>ensemble</i> reconstitutes
the Court atmosphere of 1840-45. In the opening
chapters of the "Boyhood of a Great King," I have
given a brief account of the upbringing of five generations
of the British Royal Family. Since then I
have come across an interesting bundle of papers
once in possession of the Earl of Holdernesse, for
some years governor of the children of George III.
In 1776 the King writes thus to Lord Holdernesse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Holdernesse</span>,&mdash;The opinion I have of your being
the most fit Person in all respects to have the direction of the
education of my Sons, which I should imagine the many
interesting Conversations I have had with you this winter
must have thoroughly convinced you, must have prepared
you to expect that the contents of your letter would occasion
equal sorrow and surprise. If you are determined in the
plan you now propose, I have no consolation but in the
knowledge of the rectitude of my intention fully to have
supported you and that your retreat is not in the least owing
to any step taken by me.</p>

<p>The daughters of George III. and Queen Charlotte
were all excellent letter writers, but their ordinary
letters fetch absurdly low prices, although many of
them are historically important. Queen Adelaide,
the consort of William IV., was fond of writing texts
on cards edged with filigree to be sold for philanthropic
purposes. Her autographs are, in consequence,
exceedingly common. The copy-book, page,
and drawing of the still-living Empress Charlotte of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
Mexico have a melancholy interest. Her autograph
and that of her ill-fated husband sell well abroad.
The late Comte de Chambord and the late Comte de
Paris wrote better hands as boys than the King of
Rome or the Prince Imperial, of whose autographs I
shall speak in connection with Napoleonic MSS.
The rough sketch of soldiers drawn by the Prince
Imperial and the artillery essay written by him at
the Royal Military College, Woolwich, certainly form
interesting items in that portion of my autograph
collection which I label the Copy-books of Kings.</p>

<p>While the present volume was going through the
press a most important sale of Royal autographs
took place at Sotheby's. At the sale of May 4,
1910, no less a sum than £5,446 6s. was realised for
195 lots. Amongst the letters of Royal personages
then dispersed, an A.L.S. of Mary Queen of Scots,
dated Chatsworth, June 13, 1570, and addressed to
her brother-in-law, Charles IX. of France, fetched
£715; a D.S. of Edward VI., £370; an A.L.S. of
Queen Mary I., £205; an A.L.S. of Queen Elizabeth,
£160; 7 A.L.S. of Catherine de Medicis, £145; a
L.S. of Henry VII., £24; a L.S. of Henry VIII.,
£25; three A.L.S. of Charles I., £55, £49, and £39
respectively, and three A.L.S. of Charles II., £25,
£23 10s., and £22 respectively. The account of the
expenses incurred at the "Meeting of the Field of
the Cloth of Gold," signed by Francis I., was sold
for £130.</p>

<p>The following examples of the handwriting of
the late Prince Consort, the late King Edward VII.,
the late Duke of Coburg, King George V., Queen
Mary, and the late Empress Frederick of Germany
may prove interesting to my readers, as well as
useful to collectors:&mdash;</p>

<span class="smcap">James Howell</span> (1595-1666).</p>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Letters</span> of affairs from such as manage them,
or are privy to them," writes Lord Bacon, "are, of
all others, the best instructors for history, and to
a diligent reader, the best histories in themselves."
Hence the peculiar and exceptional value of the
autographs of Statecraft and Diplomacy as important
sources of reliable information in dealing with the
annals of any given period of national life. Writers
like Frederic Masson have discovered that the faded
and forgotten correspondence of men and women
of fashion constitute a veritable treasury of knowledge
concerning the manners and customs of our
ancestors during the past three centuries. Almost
all the American autographs of great value<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> may be
classed in this category. It is obvious that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
writers, like Lord Chesterfield, united in their persons
the attributes of statesmen, diplomatists, and men
of fashion.</p>

<p>Eighty years ago it is evident the money value
of the letters of celebrated statesmen in no way
corresponded with their worth as potential aids
to history-making. The chronicler of 1827 already
alluded to makes no secret of the fact. "Hands
which the reins of empire might have swayed," he
frankly confesses, "are hands of very inferior value on
paper. Sir Francis Walsingham, the able and upright
secretary of Queen Elizabeth, must have five other
celebrated persons added to mount up to 9s.
The price of the great Sir Robert Walpole, who
discovered the price of more than half the House
of Commons, and made the whole of the Government
run smoothly, is 18s. Mr. Pitt, the Pilot
that weathered the storm, and Mr. Perceval, who
fell by the ball of an assassin, join hands to reach
13s.; and Lord Castlereagh, who once towered high
above the heads of the people, now needs the help
of Lord Grenville, and a Lord Chief Justice, to
lift him up to a like sum. The average value of a
common Lord Chancellor is about 2s. 6d. Lenthall,
the Speaker of the House of Commons in the
Long Parliament, and Thurloe, the Secretary of
Oliver Cromwell, are valued together at 52s. 6d."</p>

<p>I am hardly disposed to altogether credit this
statement, as large sums, comparatively speaking,
were paid even then for documents signed by
Thomas More, the Earl of Pembroke (Shakespeare's
friend), and Francis Bacon, who, according to the
writer, would be pitilessly relegated to the half-crown
class. In Frederic Barker's catalogue for
1887 I find a Privy Council letter, signed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
Bacon and several others, priced at £7 7s., and
Mr. Waller, ten years before, offers a 2 p. A.L.S.
of the younger Pitt for 18s. It was nevertheless a
letter of considerable historical value. In this kind
of autographs important finds may often be made
by buying letters written by little known personages
to eminent politicians. In a recent sale at Sotheby's
a dozen letters addressed to William Windham went
for 1s. the lot. It is quite possible they may enshrine
some unknown State secret. I lately saw at the
shop of Messrs. Ellis, in New Bond Street, a deed
signed not only by Bacon but his wife, and nearly the
whole of his relatives and connections. It is in an
excellent state of preservation, and was priced at £30.</p>

<p>At the present moment, when the sixth generation
of our Royal Family is represented in the
Senior Service, two letters of the elder Pitt, the Great
Commoner, arranging for the entry into the Navy of
the first Prince of the House of Brunswick to join
it, cannot but be interesting. These letters were
addressed in 1759 to Lord Holdernesse, and
concern the Duke of York, a younger brother of
King George III.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<i>Monday</i> ½ past 4</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Lord</span>,&mdash;I am able to put your mind entirely at
ease as to some doubts which seemed to have arisen, by
acquainting your Lordship that in consequence of the signification
of the King's pleasure by me, the Lords of the Admiralty
have ordered Captain Howe <i>to enter Prince Edward in the
Ship's books, as a volunteer for wages and victuals, and his
Retinue as part of the allowed complement of the Ship</i>. This
is the Form and puts everything out of doubt. The King is
pressing for the Departure of the Expedition, and has named
General Bligh to command the Forces. Lord Ligonier is
gone to the General to acquaint him of the King's pleasure.
I conceive Howe will sail by Thursday at latest if the weather
permits. Preparations having been ordered to be made for
the Reception of Prince Edward on Board of Captain Howe's
own ship, Mr. Cleveland informs me that <i>everything</i> will be
provided for His Royal Highness's accomodation if Bligh
accepts (for such is the style of our army) and the King should
approve the Draught of Instructions to be laid before His
Majesty tomorrow, nothing but a wind will be wanting.</p>

<p>Prince Ferdinand recommends the continuation of attack
on their coasts as <i>la guerre la plus sensible à la France de
l'attaquer dans ses Foyers</i>. And yet this great Prince is certainly
a Stranger to the Common Council, Beckford and <i>the
Buchaneers</i>. Olmutz may draw into some length; 10,000 men
in the Place and old General Marshall defending it with great
vigour. I could not possibly see General Elliot this morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>

<p>Seven years later, on the afternoon of February 22,
1766, the Premier, after a tempestuous debate, concluded
a letter to his wife in the country thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>The patriotism of William Pitt the younger, born
in the very year Prince Edward joined Captain
Howe's ship as a "volunteer for wages and victuals,"
was soon to blossom forth not only in an infantile
drama,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> but in a poem hitherto unpublished, which
I had the good fortune to obtain through Mr. F.
Sabin. It was the joint work of "impetuous
William" and his sister in the spring of 1777, and
is in the handwriting of the former:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;As the Harvest is now nearly over, I
imagine this would be a very fitting time for proposing to
assemble your Battalion on permanent duty; and there seems
chance enough of the occasion arriving for actual Service, to
make it desirable that there should be as little delay as possible.
Lord Carrington has gone to Deal Castle to-day, and
if you can contrive to see him tomorrow, or next day, I shall
be glad if you will settle with him the necessary arrangements.
I think the time should not be less than Three weeks, and in
that case, an extra allowance will be made of a guinea pr
Man, which added to the usual pay will amount to 2s pr day
for the whole period. This will enable us to give the men full
compensation for at least six or seven hours a day, on an
average; and will therefore allow of three or four long Field
Days in each week, and only short drills in the remaining
days; and such arrangement would, I think, answer every
purpose. I should hope you might fix the commencement of
permanent duty for Monday fortnight, very soon after which
day I hope to come to Walmer to make some stay. I shall
be at Dover on Tuesday next for a day, but have some business
which will carry me from thence along the Coast, and
probably back to town before I reach Walmer.</p>

<p>A year or so ago I was lucky enough to secure the
official dispatch-box bearing the Royal cipher and
his initials, which Pitt left behind him at Bath, when
returning to Putney a few days before his death. In
it is his last Whip, signed on December 31, 1805.
On January 21st he was dying, and on the 23rd he
died. This melancholy document now lies within
the forgotten dispatch-box!</p>

<p>Chesterfield&mdash;the "great" Earl of Chesterfield&mdash;died
when the younger Pitt was fourteen years old.
It is more correct to describe him as a contemporary
of his father, the Great Commoner. He was, as an
amusing and able letter-writer, superior to both, but
he loved society and they did not. In the recent
Haber Sale at New York (December 10, 1909) a
very fine Chesterfield letter only fetched £3 8s. It
is thus described:&mdash;</p>

him greatly, and only "<i>industry is wanting</i>"; another
suggestion is the manufacture of starch, and he writes
that he has been shown a method of making it from
potatoes easily and cheaply, and while the law in
England prevents it being made from anything else
than flour in that country, that law might not apply in
Ireland, and proceeds: "<i>These are the Jobbs that I wish
the People in Ireland would attend with as much Industry
and Care as they do Jobbs of a very different Nature.</i>"
Many other reflections show sound common sense.</p></div>

<p>Two years ago I gave £4 each for five unknown
and unpublished letters, written between 1762 and
1771 by Chesterfield to his relative, Mr. Welbore
Ellis Agar ("Gatty"). The specimen I now give of
them is interesting, as it concerns Bath, a city which
I regard as the great source and centre of the lighter
and more gossipy letters of the eighteenth century:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<i><span class="smcap">Bath</span>, October ye 8th 1771.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Gatty</span>,&mdash;When we parted we agreed to correspond
by way of letter, but we did not as I remember stipulate which
should make the first advance, but as I always sacrificed my
Dignity to my pleasure, I here make the first step though
Cozen and Counsillor to the <i>King</i> and your Unkle, which is a
kind of Deputy Parent. Admire my condescension. To begin,
then, with an account of my Caducity. I made my journey to
this place in two days, which I did not think I could have
done, much tired with it but alive. Since I came I have seen
no mortal till last night, when I went to the Ball with which
the new rooms were opened and when I was there I knew
not one creature except Lord and Lady Vere. The <i>new
rooms</i> are really Magnificent finely finished and furnished,
the Dancing-room, which the Lady Thanet used to call the
Posture-room, particularly spacious and adorned. A large
and fine play room, and a convenient Tea room well contrived,
either to drink or part with that liquor. So much for
this and more I cannot tell you, for as for the people who are
not yet many, they are absolute strangers to me, and I to
them. In my review of the fair sex last night I did not see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><br /><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
one tolerably handsome, so that I am in no danger of falling
in love this season, and indeed my heart and mind are so
engrossed by Mr. Agar's fair cousin <i>Mrs. Mathews</i>, that I have
no room left for a second choice. I hope that at her return
to England, he will do me what good offices he can with her;
my way is to end my letters abruptly, and without a well-turned
period.</p>

<p class='center'><i>Earl of Chesterfield to Mrs. Montague, May 14, 1771.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lord Chesterfield presents his respects to Mrs. Montague
and desires her to accept of the enclosed trifle for her poor

His ordinary letters only fetch from 3s. to 5s. Far
more costly are the letters of Curran, Grattan,

"Liberator," written from Bath:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Curran</span>,&mdash;I have wept over your letter. Oh

the subject of the details of our Petition, but if my information
on facts respecting that detail was not superior to his, I
feel my inferiority in every other respect too sensibly to dare
to differ with him. As Brutus was called the last of the
Romans so Ireland will weep over him as the last survivor
of those great spirits who <i>almost</i> burst the iron Bondage of
Britain and would have made her free but that the ancient
curse has still bound her and she lingers <i>yet</i> in slavery. How
naturally does the thought fly from his bed of sickness to the
sorrows of Ireland. The Boldest, best, most eloquent, most
enthusiastic, and perhaps more than the most persevering of
her Patriots, he was. Alas he leaves none like or second to
him. You will my friend think I declaim while I only run
rapidly through the thoughts that his illness crowds upon me.
You do well, quite well. It will, in every respect, console
you to recollect that you have done your <i>duty</i>. I rejoice with
all the joy of my heart can mingle with his state that you
have this precious opportunity of doing that duty cordially
and well. If your letter afforded me hope that I could see
your Father, so as to be able to converse with him, I would
answer your letter in person, as it is I wait only your reply to go
to you. It would suit most convenient not to leave this before
Saturday, but your reply will command me. The Funeral
must be Public. I will of course attend it. We will arouse
everything Irish in London and pay a tribute to <i>his</i> memory
unequalled by any which London has witnessed. Tell
Phillips I only wait a <i>reply</i> to join you both. Do you think
of conveying his remains to Ireland? this if practicable would
be best. Write, or get Phillips to write, as soon as you
receive this. You perceive that I write in the extreme of
haste, but I am for ten thousand reasons convinced that you
should listen to no suggestion of a private funeral. You would
repent it only once, that is all your life. Would to God
I could offer you consolation.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone was, like Wellington and Brougham,
a writer of innumerable letters. There was a demand
for them once, but at the present moment, by the
irony of fate, an average Gladstone letter fetches less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
than one of his wife. Special circumstances, however,
may give them special value. This is exemplified in
the case of the Gladstone-Manning correspondence
written from Balmoral, which I found at Brighton.
The introduction of the economical and space-saving
postcard spoiled Gladstone as a letter-writer
in his old age. Here is a typical letter of his, relating
to the present of a bust of O'Connell and interesting
at the present political juncture:&mdash;</p>


<p class='center'><i>Mr. Gladstone to Mrs. O'Connell.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Madam</span>,&mdash;I accept with many thanks the Bust you
have been so kind to send me. It is a most interesting memorial
of early days, and of a man of powerful mind and will,
and profound attachment to his Country; whose name can
never be forgotten there.</p>

<p>In my early years of Parliamentary life, casual circumstances
brought me into slight personal relations with Mr.
O'Connel, and I have ever retained the lively recollection
of his courtesy and kindness.</p>

<p>I remain, my dear Madam, your very faithful and obedient,</p>

<p class='right mr2'>
<span class="smcap">W. E. Gladstone</span>.</p>

<p>I must not omit to thank you for the kind terms in which
you speak of my efforts on behalf of Ireland, and I cling in
that confidence to the hope that a happy future is yet in store
for her.</p></div>

<p>Four years ago I saw ten letters of the late Lord
Beaconsfield catalogued at £70. Personally I regard
him as almost the last of the now extinct race of letter-writers,
for the epistolary art has succumbed beyond
hope of recovery to the combined influences of the
telegraph, the telephone, the type-writer and the
halfpenny newspaper. A "newspaper" letter, as
Mrs. Montagu, Lord Lyttelton, and Lord Bath
used to call them, would be as ridiculous as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
conversation on <i>les belles lettres</i>. How Lord Beaconsfield's
life is ever to be written with any hope
of completeness, I cannot imagine. <i>Hundreds</i> of
his letters have been sold since his death, and a
specimen of average interest can now be obtained
for 20s. or less. I have gradually acquired thirty
or forty and am certain that sooner or later a
rise in price is inevitable. People will soon discover
that in the fragmentary and wholly unsatisfactory
published collections of Beaconsfield's letters <i>the
originals have been ruthlessly mangled or transformed</i>.
I shall only include two examples in this book,
beginning with a very early one from the inevitable
Bath:&mdash;</p>


<p class='center'><i>Benjamin Disraeli to his Sister.</i></p>

<p class='center'>(Franked by E. Lytton Bulwer.)</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'>
<i><span class="smcap">Bath</span>, Thursday [Jany 24 1833]</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dearest</span>,&mdash;You ought to have rec<sup>d</sup> my letter on Sunday
and I should have answered your's immediately, but it is
almost impossible to get a frank out of Bulwer and I thought
my father w<sup>d</sup> go quite mad if he received an unprivileged
letter under present circumstances. We quit this place
tomorrow and sh<sup>d</sup> have done so to-day, but dine with a
Mr. Murray here. I like Bath very much. At a public ball
I met the Horfords, Hawksleys etc. Bulwer and myself
went in very late and got quite mobbed.</p>

<p>I have nearly finished Iskander, a very pretty thing indeed,
and have printed the 1st Vol of Alroy.</p>

<p>I have answered the agric. affair which was forwarded to
me from London.</p>

<p>Directly I am in town I will write about the bills.</p>

<p>The Horfords (father and brother here) asked us to dine,
but were engaged.</p>

<p>Met the Bayntums, but not Clementina. Rather think
I may to day.</p>

<p>Let me have a letter in Duke S<sup>t</sup>. Bulwer is getting on
immensely and I sh<sup>d</sup> not be surprised if we shortly see
him in a <i>most eminent</i> position, but this not to be spoken of.
Met Ensor.</p></div>

<p>Omitting many letters of piquant interest I come
to one written in the autumn of 1851, in which the
rising statesman deals somewhat severely with his
old friend, <i>The Times</i>. It runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'>
<i><span class="smcap">Hughenden</span>, Sept 19 1851</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sa</span>,&mdash;Your mischance was very vexatious, but
I was glad to hear that you had arrived all safe in such kind
quarters.</p>

<p>I see Jem on Tuesday, who passed a longish morning here.</p>

<p>At Monday I was at Aylesbury where I was obliged to dine
with the old society&mdash;Lowndes, Stone, Howard Wyse,
Bernard, Hale, Isham, and Young of Quainton and 3 clergymen
supported me, and Lowndes of Chesham in the chair.
I made a good speech on a difficult subject, and the meeting
seemed in heart. I saw to-day in <i>The Times</i> two columns of
incoherent and contradictory nonsense w<sup>h</sup> made me blush,
tho' I ought to be hardened by this time on such subjects.
I have seen no other papers. They can't be worse, and
perhaps may in some degree neutralise the nonsense of <i>The
Times</i>. I am only afraid the world will think it all Delphi and
diplomatic, and that the wordy obscurity was intentional,
whereas I flattered myself I was as terse and simple as suited
a farmer's table.</p>

<p>I am rather improving and getting on a little.</p>

<p>I hope you will enjoy yourself very much.</p>

<p>We went over to Cliefden the other day&mdash;there is one bed
of flowers, called the scarlet ribbon&mdash;4,000 geraniums&mdash;the
Duchess's<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> own design, very new and wonderful, winding
over a lawn like a sea-serpent, but the plantation in sad order.
The gardener has £10 per week to pay everything in his
department, as the Duchess will not spend more on a place
which yields nothing. My kind remembrances to Mrs. Peacock.</p>

Collector."</p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> a felicitous coincidence two literary autographs
of more than ordinary interest have come to light at
the moment I was preparing to write the present
chapter. The first is the discovery in the Record
Office by Dr. Wallace of the signed deposition of
Shakespeare in an early seventeenth-century lawsuit,
under the circumstances picturesquely set forth in
the issue of <i>Harper's Monthly Magazine</i> for March,
1910. Without conceding to Dr. Wallace's "find"
the supreme importance claimed for it by this able
and patient examiner of ancient MSS., there can be
no doubt that it deals a fatal and final blow to the
Baconian theory. On the very day I read Dr.
Wallace's article, Mr. J. H. Stonehouse<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> showed me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
several fictitious Shakespeare signatures fabricated
by W. H. Ireland nearly forty years after the appearance
of "Vortigern," for the avowed purpose of
demonstrating his ability to imitate them. I cannot
help thinking that Dr. Wallace's article lends
increased interest to the letter of the Shakespearean
actor, Dowton, which has already been alluded to
in these pages.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> In the elaborate essay in which the
fifth Shakespeare signature has been enshrined will
be found reproductions of the other four.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<div class="caption"><p class='center'>THE SIGNATURE OF SHAKESPEARE ON THE LAST PAGE OF HIS WILL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Adrian Joline's theory as to the "eternity of
interest" in literary autographs receives support
from the exceptionally high prices they have commanded
from the early days of the collection of
MSS., when the signatures of kings and statesmen
were almost at a discount. "I shall now," writes the
chronicler of autograph prices in 1827, "set poetry,
philosophy, history, and works of imagination against
sceptres, swords, robes, and big-wigs.... Addison
is worth £2 15s., Pope £3 5s., and Swift £3.
Thomson has sold for £5 10s. and Burns for £3 10s.
Churchill, the abuser of his compatriots, is valued at
£1 18s. In philosophy Dr. Franklin reaches £1 17s.;
in history, Hume is valued at £1 18s. and Gibbon at
only 8s. The sturdy moralist Johnson ranks at
£1 16s., the graceful trifler Sterne at £2 2s., Smollett
at £2 10s., and Richardson at £1. Scott only yields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
8s." In the half-century which intervened between
1827 and 1877 the prices of literary autographs had
risen by leaps and bounds. In his catalogue of 1876
Mr. Waller asked £8 10s. for a short Latin essay of
Thomas Gray, while Longfellow is priced at £1 18s.,
George Borrow at £3 3s., and Wordsworth at £1 1s.
A fine letter of Schiller's is priced at £2 5s. In the
next catalogue (1878) I find the following: Gibbon
(a fine A.L.S.) £4 4s.; Voltaire (a 2 pp. A.L.S.)
£3 15s.; Rousseau, a series of letters, including one
of the philosopher, £3 10s.; five verses by Scott,
£4 4s.; William Cowper, A.L.S., £3 7s. 6d.; Gray, a
bundle of printed matter including one hundred lines
of MS., £6 6s. In the late Mr. Frederick Barker's
catalogues of the same period we have Edmund
Burke (A.L.S.), £3 3s.; Thomas Hood (A.L.S.), £2 2s.;
Voltaire (A.L.S.), £4 4s.; Horace Walpole (A.L.S.),
£3 5s.; and a love-letter from John Keats to Fanny
Brawne, £28.</p>

<p>In cataloguing the last-named item Mr. Barker
says "that one of these celebrated letters realised
by auction a short time since no less than £47."
He also prices two A.L.S. of Robert Burns at £35
and £32 respectively. It will be remembered that
in 1827 the price for a Burns letter was £3 10s. only.
For a letter of Schiller (4 pp., 8vo, 1801) Mr. Barker
asks £7 7s. In several catalogues of this period
I find Keats letters averaging £20 to £30. The
interesting catalogue issued by Mr. Barker in 1891
is remarkable for its wealth of literary <i>rariora</i>.
Autograph letters are priced in it as follows:
Schiller, £10 10s.; Burns, £25; Wordsworth, £3 3s.;
Thackeray, £25. The last-named letter is worth
describing. It was addressed to Miss Holmes, with
a postscript on the inside of the envelope, and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
third sheet a clever sketch of Thackeray and Bulwer
Lytton standing behind a lady seated at a piano.
The letter itself runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is a comfortable Hotel in this street, kept by a
respectable family man, the charges are Beds gratis,
Breakfasts, thank you, dinner and tea, ditto, servants included
in these charges. Get a cab from the station, and come
straightway to No. 13. I dine out with the Dean of St. Paul's
(you have heard of a large meeting house we have between
Ludgate Hill and Cheapside, with a round roof?). Some
night we will have a select T party, but <i>not</i> whilst you are
staying here. When you are in your lodgings. Why I will
ask Sir Edward George Earle Lytton, Bulwer Lytton himself.
Bulwer's boots are very fine in the accompanying masterly
design (refer to the sketch), remark the traces of emotion on
the cheeks of the other author (the notorious W. M. T.), I
have caricatured Dr. Newman (with an immense nose) and
the Cardinal too, you ought to know that.</p></div>

<p>This letter would be now worth quite £50, and
some of the fine illustrated Thackeray letters now
in possession of Mr. Frank Sabin would probably
be cheap at £100 each. Mr. Sabin's collection of the
Thackerayana is probably unrivalled both as regards
the United Kingdom and America.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>In Mr. Barker's 1891 catalogue there are four
letters of Shelley, priced at £18 18s., £19 19s.,
£10 10s., and £9 9s. respectively. There is also
a Schiller at £25, and an Alexander Pope covering
one page 8vo only at £8. Darwin is already at
£1 10s., Disraeli at 18s., and the Dickens letters
average about £2. A letter of Dr. Priestley, worth
perhaps 5s. in 1827, is now offered at £2 2s.</p>

<p>Milton, to a certain extent, was a contemporary
of both Pepys and Evelyn, but he had been
dead sixteen years at the date of the letter now
quoted. The value of Milton's autographs is fully
discussed by Dr. Scott in the pages of <i>The
Archivist</i>.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> When the subject first attracted my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
attention early in 1904 much excitement was caused
by the appearance in Sotheby's Salerooms of what
was alleged to be 32 pp. of the MS. of "Paradise
Lost." The value of the document was warmly
discussed at the time and sensational bidding was
anticipated. It was bought in, but I believe it was
ultimately sold to an American collector for £5,000
or thereabouts. Mr. Quaritch now possesses a very
fine Milton deed, which is priced at £420, and is
dated November 27, 1623. It is signed by John
Milton, as one of the witnesses to the Marriage
Covenant between Edward Phillips of London and
Anne, daughter of John Milton, Citizen and Scrivener
of London.</p>

<p>Letters of Dryden and Cowley have fetched very
high prices,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and the autograph of Edmund Waller
is also rare, but Alexander Pope's letters are
abundant, although they are much less valuable than
those of Swift. A good letter of Pope can be
obtained for from £7 to £10. The late Mr.
Frederick Barker told me he was once asked as
an autographic expert to advise a well-known
nobleman, Lord H., who said he had a bundle of
letters written by <i>one of the Popes</i> in his possession
and desired to ascertain their value, but as
they were merely signed "A Pope" he did not
know which of the Holy Fathers was responsible
for them! Mr. Barker of course identified the
"bard of Twickenham" as their author. They
were bound up under his supervision, and fetched
over £200, but still the owner was not quite
satisfied! Of the four Pope letters in my collection,
only one has ever been published, and that
but partially. It is of such manifest historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I trouble you with my answers to the Inclosed
wch I beg you to give to Mr Lyttelton as I wd do him all ye
Good I can, wh the Virtues I know him possest of, deserve;
and therefore I wd Present him with so Honest a Man as you,
and you with so Honest a man as he: The Matter concerning
Urns I wd gladly leave in yr Care, and I desire four small
ones with their Pedestals, may be made, and two of a size
larger. I'l send those sizes to you and I send a Draft of ye
two sorts, 4 of one and 2 of ye other. I am going to insert in
the body of my Works, my two last Poems in Quarto. I
always Profit myself of ye opinion of ye publick to correct
myself on such occasions. And sometimes the Merits of
particular Men, whose names I have made free with for
examples either of Good or of Bad, determine me to
alteration. I have found the Virtue in you more than I
certainly knew before till I had made experiment of it,
I mean Humility! I must therefore in justice to my own
conscience of it bear testimony to it and change the epithet
I first gave you of <i>Low-born</i>, to <i>Humble</i>. I shall take care to
do you the justice to tell everybody this change was not
made at yours, or at any friends request for you: but my own
knowledge (of) you merited it. I receive daily fresh proofs
of your kind remembrance of me. The Bristol waters, the
Guinea Hens, the Oyl and Wine (two Scripture benedictions)
all came safe except ye wine, wch was turned on one side, and
spilt at ye Corks. However tis no loss to <i>me</i> for that sort
I dare not drink on acct of ye Bile, but my friends may and
that is the same thing as if I did. Adieu! Is Mr Hook with
you? I wish I were, for a month at least; for less I wd not
come. Pray advise him not to be so modest. I hope he sees
Mr. Lyttelton. I must expect your good offices with Mrs.
Allen, so let her know I honour a good woman much but a
good Wife more.</p>

<p>My other three Pope letters are unknown. They
are addressed to Mr. Bethel on Tower Hill, London,
Mr. Charles Ford in Park Place, and Mr. Jonathan
Richardson, of Queen Square, London. The last-named
was catalogued last year as written to <i>Samuel</i>
Richardson. I gave £5 for it. Mr. Barker valued
it at £8 in 1891. It provides an antidote to the
unkind things Pope wrote about "Sulphureous" Bath
on other occasions:&mdash;</p>

<p>The letters of Horace Walpole, who generally
wrote for posterity, are valuable,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> but by no means
as costly as those of Thomas Gray. Mr. Quaritch
lately showed a group of holograph letters, illustrating
the "quadruple alliance" of Gray, Walpole, West,
and Ashton, which began at Eton. It included two
fairly long letters of Gray and Walpole. I consider
the collection very cheap at £55. Here is a characteristic

<p>The value of Johnson's letters has varied very little
during the past quarter of a century, an A.L.S. of
exceptional interest often bringing £40 or £50.
Possibly his historic letters to Macpherson and
Chesterfield or his ultimatum to Mrs. Thrale would
now fetch considerably more. In the Haber Sale at
New York a 2 pp. 4to A.L.S. dated April 13, 1779,

<p>For some years I have been an assiduous collector

It was in the earliest of these (once the property of
Sir Theodore Martin) that he made his despairing

<p>It w<sup>d</sup> ill become me who have been so greatly [much]

refuse to do what I could] disregard [not respond to] the
application you are so good as to make on behalf of Mr.

<p>History had repeated itself, only the rôles were
reversed. In 1832 the benefactor was Crabbe, and
the distressed man of letters Hunt!</p>

<p>I have elected to speak of Burke amongst the
writers, although he can claim a high place amongst
the statesmen. His letters are always valuable,
although the price fetched for two exceptionally fine
specimens at the Haber Sale (New York, December
10, 1909) was disappointing. A long letter, written
in his twentieth year, brought only £4 8s.; a splendid
letter from Bath a short time before his death was
sold for £6 8s. The following letter from Edmund
Burke to Mrs. Montagu (one of many I have the
good fortune to possess) has a distinct vein of
American interest:&mdash;</p>

together with my acknowledgement for your kindness, the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
reward you desire for acts of friendship, an account of the full
effect of them. Mrs. James's letter was undoubtedly what it
ought to be on application from you. We have nothing to
complain of Mrs. J. in point of civility but there is no further
result of your indisposition. As yet indeed we do not despair.
But to give the application its full effect on him, if in answer
to Mrs. J. you keep the matter in some degree alive, I do not
question but that it will succeed at last. Almost all the others
are secure.</p>

<p>I cannot at all express how much obliged I am for the
extremely friendly manner in which you take up my friends
Mr. Burke's case. He is himself as sensible, as he is worthy
of your goodness. It is something to be distinguished by the
regards of those who regard but few. But to have a distinguished
part in the mind where all have their places is
much more flattering.</p>

<p>We have now almost finished our tedious Sessions; and I
hope to make you my acknowledgement when you return,
somewhat more at leisure. The news from America is not
very pleasing. Indeed I know of no News but that of Peace
which can be so, to any well-disposed mind. General Howe
has been driven from Boston, partly by scarcity, partly by a
sharp Cannonade and Bombardment. He therefore made his
disposition so well that they had not induced his return soon
enough to give him any disturbance. He has collected everything
with him and he has retired to the only place we have
now on that extensive coast, Halifax, where, I doubt, for some
little time at least he will not be much better commanded in
point of provision though he will be practically out of reach
of an enemy. Mrs. Burke joins me with all the rest of the
family in faithful pledge to you, in the best compliments to
yourself and to your most agreeable Miss Gregory.</p>

<p>Of the literary autograph letters and MSS. of the
Victorian era the highest prices are obtained for those
of Alfred Tennyson and George Meredith. In a

author's copy of Tennyson's "Ode on the Death of
the Duke of Wellington," with thirty lines of MS.
additions and a large number of alterations and corrections,
is priced at £120. The MS. draft of his
famous dedication to Queen Victoria published in
1853, and consisting of eight four-line verses, is
considered a little more valuable. An ordinary 8vo
letter of one page frequently fetches as much as £2
or £3. George Meredith's MSS. have been lately
sold for several hundred pounds, and an ordinary
letter would be cheap at anything between £2 and
£3. Through the kindness of my friend Mr. Clement
Shorter I am able to give a specimen of Meredith's
handwriting.</p>

notes with amusing sketches in pen and ink and
other oddities. One of these (from the splendid collection
of Mr. Sabin) forms one of the illustrations of this
volume. Into another he introduces a typical Scotch
"sandwich-man" carrying on his back the advertisement
of the Thackeray Lectures at Merchants' Hall,
Glasgow. From my own collection I give a very
interesting example of Thackeray's wit, in the shape
of a letter addressed to Count d'Orsay, on the subject
of the proposed publication of a sacred picture
by the famous dandy. On the back of the circular
announcing its appearance he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Count</span>,&mdash;This note has just come to hand, and
you see I take the freedom with you of speaking the truth.
I dont like this announcement at all. Our Saviour and the
Count d'Orsay ought not to appear in those big letters. It
somehow looks as if you and our Lord were on a par, and put
forth as equal attractions by the publisher. Dont mind my
saying this, for I'm sure this sort of announcement (merely
on account of the unfortunate typography) is likely to shock
many honest folks.</p>

<p>Early Dickens letters of any length are eagerly
sought for, and sell for nearly three times as much
as those written between 1850 and his death. I am
able to give illustrations of some exceptionally early
Thackeray and Dickens letters, which came into the
possession of Mr. George Gregory, of Bath, through
whose hands the Autograph Album of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
Mrs. Sheridan recently passed. The earliest Dickens
letter, of the fifteen autographs in my collection,
was written when he was in his twenty-ninth year.
It is interesting as containing a frank exposition of
his political creed:&mdash;</p>


<p class='center'><i>Charles Dickens at Broadstairs to Frederick Dickens,
Commissariat, Treasury, Whitehall.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'>
<i>Sunday September Twelfth 1841.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Fred</span>,&mdash;The wording of the Minute is certainly
discouraging. If I saw any way of helping you by coming up
to town, I would do so, immediately. But I cannot possibly
apply to the Tories for <i>anything</i>. I daresay they would be
glad enough if I would, but I cannot with any regard to
honor, consistency, or truth, ask any favour of people
whom politically, I despise and abhor. It would tie my
hands, seal my lips, rob my pen of its honesty, and bind me
neck and heels in discreditable fetters.</p>

<p><i>Is</i> Archer in Town? If so, have you spoken to him? If
not, when is he coming? You should speak to him certainly.
I have told you before, that I am much afraid you have not
treated him with that show of respect, which he has a right to
claim. Why in the name of God should he have a personal
dislike to you, but for some such reason as this?</p>

<p>If you think, and I see no objection to your asking Mr.
Archer the question, that without doing anything improper, you
might memorialise the Treasury, I will draw a memorial for
you. If you have reason to think this would be unofficial
and ill-advised, I know of nothing better than waiting
and hoping.</p>

<p>I should be as sorry as you, if you were to lose this step.

<p>George Augustus Sala and Edmund Yates were

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Lady Wolseley</span>,&mdash;My wife who during my absence
is my Postmistress General, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Secretary of State for Home and Foreign Affairs and Chief
Commissioner of Works all rolled into one, has forwarded me
your note, and has scribbled on the margin "with two lovely
photographs." I hasten to thank you for the graceful and
thoughtful kindness which has prompted your welcome gift.
I am proud to believe that you <i>know</i> how much I admire and
esteem your illustrious husband; how eagerly I have followed
the course of his splendid and well-deserved fortunes, and
how highly I value the friendship with which during so many
years he has honoured me. It is really to me a pleasure to
have grown old when I remember that amongst my most
prized relics at home are a visiting card inscribed "<i>Major</i>
Wolseley, for Mr. Sala, St. Lawrence Hall, Montreal 1863";
the walking stick which <i>Sir Garnet</i> Wolseley brought me home
from South Africa; the letter which <i>Lord</i> Wolseley wrote me
from the Kremlin, Moscow on Coronation Day 1883, to which
I am now able to add "two lovely photographs" and your
kind note. Were I going alone on my long and arduous
journey, my abiding hope would be, of course, to come home
safe and sound to my wife. Happily we are not to be
separated (although the friendly but cynical solicitor, who
made my will just before I left town was good enough to
remark <i>you must add a codicil in case you are both drowned</i>);
so we shall both, during our wanderings be able to nourish
the pleasant hope that we shall be permitted on our return to
pay our homage to the <i>Earl</i> and <i>Countess</i> Wolseley. I have,
dear Madam, in my time, prophesied a great deal more in
print about your Lord than you are aware of, and I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are some autograph collectors who limit their
sphere of operations to the writings of great sailors and
soldiers. The subject has already been touched on
incidentally under the head of Royal Autographs, for
James II. and William IV. were for a time Lord High
Admirals of England, while other sovereigns met
the enemy on the field of battle.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> If Wellington
can claim distinction as our greatest soldier, he
ranks also amongst our most prolific letter-writers.
The same may be said of Nelson with almost equal
truth. Of Wellington's innumerable letters, a great
many are supposed to have been written by his
Secretary, Colonel Gurwood, and Nelson's amanuensis
is also said to have successfully imitated the
handwriting of his chief. There are numerous
facsimiles of the letters of both Nelson and
Wellington, and the axiom <i>caveat emptor</i> cannot
be too frequently remembered when a suspicious
specimen is offered for sale. In 1827 we are
informed that "English Generals and Admirals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
vary greatly in value," and they do still. We are
told, moreover, that at this epoch "the Royalist
Prince Rupert is worth £1 9s., while the Parliamentary
General, Fairfax, with four Peers for his
supporters, is worth only 10s. The naval hero,
Lord Nelson, commands £2 15s., while four other
gallant admirals sink to 7s. 3d. each. Washington
ranks with Cromwell at £5 15s. 6d., and leaves all
other competitors behind." To-day a letter of
Thomas Fairfax would bring anything from £7 to
£20 or more, and a good D.S. at least £4 or £5. His
autographs are always much in request. Washington
letters have realised as much as £100 and more,
and so have Cromwell's.</p>

<p>In 1876-77-78 Mr. Waller was selling letters of
Hood and Rodney at prices varying from 4s. 6d.
to 7s. and "Wellingtons" at an average of 5s.,
but asked 12s. 6d. for a good letter of Villeneuve,
who was defeated and taken prisoner at Trafalgar.
In the same catalogue I find an A.L.S. of Wellington
for 3s. 6d., and "fine specimens" of Turenne
Mordaunt, Earl of Peterborough (Commander-in-Chief
of the Forces in Spain <i>temp.</i> Queen Anne),
priced respectively at £2 10s. Five years ago, however,
a short letter written by the Iron Duke on the
evening after Waterloo realised £105 at Sotheby's,
and, as I have already stated, Wellington paid £60 for
two similar letters during his lifetime&mdash;and committed
them to the flames. At this time I see three interesting
letters of Marlborough and three of his wife, with
one document signed by the latter, were sold in a lot
for £10 10s. Very good letters of Marlborough may
even now be bought in Germany and Belgium for
£3 or £4. In the "eighteen-seventies" very little
Nelson MS. seems to have been in the market, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
Mr. Frederick Barker offered a long A.L.S. of Lady
Nelson (May 2, 1805) for 6s., and "directions for
approaching Cadiz, 1 p. folio, wholly in Nelson's handwriting,"
for £3 5s. He priced two good A.L.S. of
1794 and 1795 at £5 5s. and £4 4s. In 1887 I met
with a letter of General Gordon, quoted as "very
rare," for £2 2s. In the same catalogue is a fine letter
of Prince Rupert for £3 3s. I frankly envy the purchaser
for 9s. 6d. of a letter written by Marshal Ney,
from Montreuil, Boulogne, in 1804, when the terror
of French invasion was at its height.</p>

<p>At the present moment there is little demand for
the letters of the less known sailors and soldiers of
the latter part of the seventeenth and first half of the
eighteenth centuries, like Shovel, Wager, and Rooke,
and I have seen a letter of Vernon, whose coat of
grogram gave rise to the familiar word which still
denotes the dilution of spirits with water, sold for 5s.!
There is, however, one naval autograph of this period
which now commands high prices. I allude to letters
and other MSS. of the ill-fated John Byng, judicially
murdered on March 14, 1757, "<i>pour encourager les
autres</i>," as Voltaire says in "Candide," or in other
words, to save the face of an inefficient and discredited
Ministry. I gave £3 in 1907 for an
A.L.S. of his which thirty years ago was sold by
Mr. Waller for 12s. 6d., but I regard as a veritable
autographic treasure the original of his will, which
bears his signature in three places, and was executed
only forty-eight hours before his tragic death. The
<i>sang-froid</i> displayed in its elaboration shows the
courage and deliberation of the unlucky admiral
when face to face with the "Grim Sergeant."</p>

more costly than those of the Elizabethan heroes of
1588. They now hold, as I shall presently show, the
record as regards both price and interest. I have
already alluded to the perils and pitfalls of Nelson
forgeries. The collector must, of course, bear in mind
the striking differences in the calligraphy of the great
Admiral before and after the loss of his right arm
in July, 1797. The earliest example I possess of
Nelson's handwriting is a commission, signed on
April 5, 1781, by him as well as by Lord Lisbourne,
Bamber Gascoyne, and J. Greville. Nelson was then
twenty-three. He was thirty-nine when he penned
with his <i>right hand</i> the following historic letter to
Earl Spencer:&mdash;</p>

<p>Two months later occurred the accident which
deprived Nelson of his right hand. The Bath facsimile<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
is a good specimen of his writing with his left
hand in the last years of the eighteenth century. In
reading any life of Nelson one cannot help being
struck with the tenderness of the letters he addressed
to his wife up to their abrupt separation. At the end
of 1799, while he was still in the Mediterranean, she
wrote him the following letter, now in my collection:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Husband</span>,&mdash;I have seen a letter from Lady Berry
to Mr. Davison. She tells him of Sir Edward's letter, dated
Foudroyant, Minorca, Oct<sup>r</sup> 18<sup>th</sup>, and mentions you were quite
well which I hope is true. I dined a few days back at Mr
Nepean's. He told me you were at Gibralter (<i>sic</i>). I thanked
him for his intelligence. Would have given something to
have asked a question, but that could not be done&mdash;therefore
I still flatter myself as you are half way we may stand some
chance of seeing you. Capt<sup>n</sup> Foley has this instant left me.
From what Capt<sup>n</sup> Hood said I was in great hopes Capt<sup>n</sup> F
had very lately seen you. He is full of the Earl's commanding
the Channel Fleet. Lord Bridport has sailed again. Our
good father received yesterday [a letter] from your B<sup>r</sup>. William
teazing him about no dignitaries (<i>sic</i>) for the Nelson family.
I must write to the Rector and beg him not to be so tiresome,
for truly I am nursing and doing everything I can to make
your father comfortable and then he is quite upset by one of
these epistles Mr W. N. [William Nesbit] requested me
to give Mr Windham a <i>gentle hint</i>. Sir Peter and Lady
Parker called yesterday. We have agreed to go and see the
famous French milliner. Lady P declares they will put me
in a sack and send me to Bonaparte. Her spirits are good
indeed. She sends Sir Peter to the Admiralty to hear when
you are expected home. I don't know what she is <i>not</i> to do&mdash;Dance
and grow young. We dined yesterday (Susanna I

</div>

<p>The tone of Lady Nelson's letter to her husband
presents a striking contrast to that in which, little
more than a year later, he speaks of her in a letter
to Lady Hamilton, for which I paid a very large
sum early in 1905. As might be expected, the
demand for Nelson autographs became more urgent
as the centenary of Trafalgar approached, but, on
the whole, the rise of price was not quite as marked
as might be expected, although one particular letter
to Lady Hamilton, apparently little more striking
than the one now given, was sold for £1,050. The
great Nelson sensation (as far as the autograph market
is concerned) came off some five months later, viz., on
March 14, 1906, when the unique Nelson document
described as follows was disposed of at Christie's:&mdash;</p>


<p class='p2 center'>NELSON'S FAMOUS MEMORANDUM TO THE FLEET
ON THE EVE OF TRAFALGAR.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="blockquot_2">

<p>133. NELSON (ADMIRAL LORD) "GENERAL MEMORANDUM,"
<span class="smcap">in the Autograph of the Famous
Admiral, in which he Foreshadowed the Plan of
Attack at Trafalgar, and which he actually
Carried Out. "Victory," off Cadiz, 9 Oct. 1805</span>,
8 pp. 4to.</p></div>

<p>Thinking it almost impossible to bring a fleet of 40 sail of
the line into a line of Battle, in variable winds, thick weather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
and other circumstances which must occur, without such a
loss of time, that the opportunity would probably be lost....
I have therefore made up my mind to keep the fleet in that
position of sailing (with the exception of the first and second
in command) that the order of sailing is to be the order of
battle; placing the fleet in two lines of 16 ships each, with an
advanced squadron of eight of the fastest sailing two-decked
ships [which] will always make if wanted a line of 24 sail, on
whichever line the Commander-in-Chief may direct, etc.</p></div>

<p>It was bought by Mr. Frank Sabin for £3,600.
A newspaper controversy at once arose on the
subject of the transaction. Public attention was
forcibly directed to the supreme importance of the
document, and an effort was made to secure it for
the nation, Mr. Sabin most generously offering to
sell it to the authorities at cost price. The movement
to acquire it fell through, owing to the
impossibility of obtaining a grant-in-aid. Quite
unexpectedly the late Mr. B. M. Woollan offered to
buy it for the nation, but stipulated that during his
life-time the MS. "should remain in his possession and
be accessible to the public in the Town Hall at
Tunbridge Wells." This was agreed to, Mr. Sabin
maintaining his proposal to sell at cost price. The
Trafalgar order was framed in oak taken from the
<i>Victory</i> under the direction of a British Museum
expert, and after remaining for some time at Tunbridge
Wells, has found (since Mr. Woollan's death)
a final resting-place in the National Collection. On
March 14, 1906, Messrs. Maggs paid £170 for one
of the official copies of the "General Memorandum,"
viz., that addressed to William Lechmere, Captain
of the <i>Thunderer</i>. It filled 5 pp. It was marked
"secret," and contained a note to the effect that "the
Captain should return the Secret Memorandum to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
the <i>Victory</i> when the <i>Thunderer</i> quits the fleet for
England." The original has been, or will shortly be,
facsimiled by the British Museum MS. Department.
Collectors will then be able to procure copies of it at
an almost nominal price. During the weeks which
followed March 14, 1906, the "Memorandum"
became the subject of a dozen romantic legends.
Several years ago I purchased the signature of
Nelson appended to the last few lines of another of
these "official copies" for one sovereign. It was
formally attested by the widow of the Captain to
whom it was originally sent. I possess a 3 pp.
A.L.S. written by Lord Nelson to Lord Collingwood
on board H.M.S. <i>Victory</i>, on October 10, 1805&mdash;eleven
days before Trafalgar. It cost £20. Some
time since, the album of the Honourable Charles
Greville, the first lover of Emma Hart (Lady Hamilton)
was broken up. Amongst the documents I
purchased from it was a MS. account of Nelson's
household expenses while residing in Bond Street,
with Mr. Greville, from April 7 to 18, 1803.</p>

<p>The letters of "Nelson's Hardy"<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> fetch from £1
to £2 each. They lack style, but are characterised
by the breezy heartiness which was typical of the
man whom Nelson loved and trusted. The discovery
of many hundreds of Hardy's letters to his Dorset
relatives in 1905 enabled me, writing in collaboration
with my friend the Rev. R. G. Bartelot, to supply
to some extent a long-felt want in naval history.
Here are two Hardy letters which came to light
subsequent to our examination of the great mass of
his correspondence:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Manfield</span>,&mdash;We are in Hourly expectation of the

We shall sail as soon as possible for Portsmouth, and from
thence to the North Sea. After we have done <i>the business</i>
there, which we expect to do in about two months, the Flag
is again to be hoisted in San Josef. The Squadron under Sir
Henry Harvey arrived the day before yesterday and sailed
the same evening to detach a squadron after the ships that
left Brest about a fortnight ago. Lawrence arrived yesterday
with Roberts. He is a fine lad and will do, but he is very
young. Admiral [Lord Nelson] tells me he saw you. You
landed and of course you made your <i>grand salam</i> to him. I
suppose a number of <i>wonderful</i> stories has been told of San
Josef in and about Dorchester. Our Beer is reduced to six
bottles and on a moderate calculation that cannot last more
than three days. Therefore you will add to the many obligations
I am under to you if you will order our friend Oakley to

<p>I have already alluded to the varying prices of
Wellington's letters, which depend entirely on the
time at which they were written. If dated June 17,
18, 19 or 20, 1815, they might be worth anything
from £50 upwards; letters from the Peninsula on
military topics bring from £2 to £5, but I only
gave 30s. for the note and envelope franked and
addressed to Lady Sidmouth, covering a lock of
Napoleon's hair&mdash;the latter being included in the
price! In my opinion there could not possibly be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
more interesting souvenir of the victor of Waterloo.
The letters of Sir Hudson Lowe are sold from £1
to £3, those of Marshal Blücher fetching about the
same price.</p>

<p>Few of the letters of living warriors fetch high
prices. The amusing and satirical letters of
Frederick Burnaby are worth from 4s. to 10s.,
but I refrain from publishing those in my collection.
Letters of Earl Roberts and Viscount
Wolseley average from 3s. to 5s., but Lord
Kitchener writes little and declines persistently to
be "drawn." I once saw a letter of his priced
at £2 12s. 6d., but that was when the Boer War
was at its height.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> December 17, 1907, four-and-twenty letters of
Ludwig van Beethoven were sold at Sotheby's
for £660, notwithstanding the fact that the autographs
of musicians, artists, and actors, are not
even mentioned by the chronicler of prices in
1827! For the solitary letter of Beethoven in
my collection I paid M. Noël Charavay £10,
and it was at the same outlay I acquired in
England an interesting letter of Joseph Haydn's.
In extra-illustrating the "History of the Festivals
of the Three Choirs," of which my ancestor, William
Hayes, Mus. Doc. (1707-1777), was one of the
founders and subsequently a conductor, I acquired
considerable experience in the market prices of
all sorts of musical MSS.</p>

</div>

<p>In this particular class of autographs "album
specimens" have often considerable value, for
musicians have always been the target of the autograph-hunter,
especially so of those of the fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
sex.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> It is no uncommon sight after a "star"
concert to see the tired-out central attraction in
a state of autograph siege, either for inscriptions
in albums or signatures to photographs. The
plaintive autograph letter of Franz Liszt tells the
tale of the request made on behalf of the owner
of a Royal Album to the exigencies of which
he gracefully surrendered. A few bars of music
written and signed by Handel would now be
worth quite £20 or £25; and some day the
musical autographs of Edward Elgar will fetch
very high prices. William and Philip Hayes rank
in the first class of English composers of Church
music, although the father was overshadowed by
his loyal friendship for Handel, and the latter by
his admiration for Haydn. I have acquired (with
one or two trifling exceptions) the MSS. of their
compositions, several of which have never been
published. Like most musicians, the Hayeses were
humourists. They wrote anthems and chants, but
they won fame in their generation by catches,
canons, glees, madrigals, and fugitive pieces of all
sorts. The tuneful airs of Philip Hayes [1738-1797]
re-echoed amidst the glades of Blenheim, and were
often heard at Ranelagh, Vauxhall, and "Marybone."<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
Musical autographs have risen considerably in price
during the past thirty years, as shown at the comparatively
recent Taphouse Sale. A very fine letter
of Chopin's was offered for sale at 250 francs last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
year by Madame Veuve Gabriel Charavay. Letters
of Mendelssohn and Wagner are in great request.
The former vary in price from £3 to £10. Although
Richard Wagner was a prolific letter-writer, any letter
of his is worth £5 or thereabouts, and many have
sold at from £20 to £50. I have never seen an
A.L.S. of Handel's in the sale-rooms. A good one
will probably fetch £50. A fragment of one of his
compositions, once in the possession of William
Hayes, lately realised £100. Much of his music
seems to have been written out by Smart.</p>

<p>In 1876 Mr. Waller offered a letter of Beethoven's
for sale at £3 10s.; one by Dr. Blow for £1 and
2 pp. of one of William Boyce's compositions for
7s. 6d.! The latter would certainly fetch 40s. to-day,
but thirty years ago autographs of Catalani, Bishop,
Cooke, Holmes, Hummel, Michael Kelly, Lablache,
Loder, Meyerbeer, Offenbach, Louisa Pyne, Rossini,
Rudersdorff, Tamburini, and Samuel Wesley averaged
about 3s.! I lately gave £3 3s. for the signed MS. of
Wesley's "Ode on the Death of Boyce," the
bicentenary of whose birth occurs this year (1910),
in which also the centenary of the birth of
Wesley's musical son, Samuel Sebastian Wesley,
might appropriately be celebrated at Gloucester.
Amongst Mr. Frank Sabin's autographic <i>rariora</i> is
the MS. of the original score of Thomas Moore's
"Last Rose of Summer." There is a great demand
in America just now for Moore MSS. of this sort,
although ordinary letters rarely fetch high prices.
Charles Burney's letters (of which I have many) are
to my mind always interesting, although they only
bring from 15s. to 30s. in the sale-rooms.</p>

<p>For some collectors the Drama offers a peculiar
fascination. I have already described the letter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
William Wilson of the "Fortune" Theatre, with
whom Shakespeare possibly played.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The great
dramatist himself, from the autograph point of view,
has been alluded to. In turning over the catalogues of
1876-86 one is struck with the high prices of letters
of David Garrick and Sarah Siddons. Garrick rarely
wrote a dull letter. When Paul Sandby asked for a
box he replied&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I am merely anxious to know how you
and Mr. Piozzi are, and the distance between me and your
fair daughters, are now so great that I get no accounts of you.
You know of old, my distaste of writing, and I know full well
my inability of amusing you, so that my letter has nothing to
recommend it, except the true love of the writer, which knows
no change. Often, very often, do I think of you, and most
sincerely do I lament your suffering, but there is nowhere but
heaven I believe that is exempt from affliction; but dear Soul
let me hear from you. You have heard of the fire in which I
lost every stage ornament so many years collecting, and at so
great expense of time and money. All my Jewels, all my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
lace, and in short nothing left. The Duke of Northumberland
has given my Brother Ten thousand pounds! and the
manner of bestowing this noble gift was so great as anything
I have ever heard or read of,</p>

<p>but poor fellow he is I fear in a wretched state of health, yet
he looked the other night in Macbeth as beautiful as ever; he
is never now without his cough, which they say is gouty (certainly
the disorder is flying about him) and if it would come
to a good fit that he woud be well. It seems a strange thing
to say that a man recovers his health by the loss of his limbs.
So thinks poor Mr. Piozzi I suppose, poor dear Soul, how he
has suffered from it! and <i>you</i>! You will perhaps scarcely
believe how often and how tenderly I think of you, and how
deeply I regret the distance between us, but it is nevertheless
true. Pray dear Soul let me hear from you very soon and tell
me truly how your health and spirits hold out the incessant
claims upon them. I have got Cecilia home from school, she
is very well at present, but to keep her well she must have sea
bathing in the summer. Is there any place of that sort near
Brynn Bella? if so, I shoud hope I might be able to see you
sometimes. I have got a genteel well principled young
woman as a Governess for her, and my family which would
consist of seven or eight persons would perhaps be too large
to be accommodated very near you. Oh that you were again
at Streatham! Remember me very kindly to dear Mr Piozzi.
God bless and support you my very dear friend. I am
unalterably</p>

<p>Fine letters from Mrs. Siddons fetch from £10 to

less, for I note an invitation "to dine at pretty Westbourne"
has just been sold (February 28, 1910) for
£2 14s. The letters of the brother of the great
actress, J. P. Kemble, sell at from £1 to £3 each. He
evidently (according to one of the specimens in my
collection) moved in very high circles. This letter is
addressed to Sir Thomas Lawrence, whose fatal relations
with the Siddons family circle have already
been alluded to:&mdash;</p>

<p>The most curious letters of that mysterious personage
the Chevalier d'Éon in my collection relate
to two public exhibitions of his skill as a fencer,
given in Bath during the year 1796. While staying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
in his native Tonnerre the <i>ex-chargé d'affaires</i> gave
a supper in honour of Prince Henry of Prussia.
In a bundle of his MSS. I bought in France I
found the bill for the historic feast. It was not
expensive, and must surely have been enjoyed

<p>The letters of artists do not as a rule command
large prices, but there are many exceptions. I have

more than I can say of writing to any body else, and I insist on
it you don't take it for a mere complement; your last letter
pleased more than I'll say, but this I will own if the postman

You'll find by the enclosed that I shall be glad to be a small contributer

Garrick was going to be married to the Violetta when you
went away. I supt with him last night and had a deal of talk

<p>In May, 1810, George Cruikshank, born in 1792,
was in the thick of the fight which the caricaturists
waged against Napoleon. It was seventy years later
than the date of Morland's grotesque scrawl that
there appeared in <i>The Times</i> (December 30, 1871)
a letter from "Glorious George" claiming to be the
originator of the idea of "Oliver Twist." On the
following day Charles Manby, a mutual friend of
the writer and the artist, thus writes to the latter:&mdash;</p>

<i>December 30 1871</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear old friend</span>,&mdash;I see with pleasure that, as I
expected you have in the "Times" of this day vindicated your
claim to originating the story of "Oliver Twist," which I have
a notion you told me of a long time ago. I am persuaded that
Dickens himself, would, with his inherent love of truth, have
confirmed your statement, and it is a pity that his historian
should have written vehemently on the subject. Be prepared
with your Sketches, etc. to maintain the position which will be
hotly contested, although in reality there is so much positive
merit in all that Dickens originated and did, that there is
not any necessity for laying claim to the works of others,&mdash;his
collaborateurs. I should much like someday to see the
sketches in question&mdash;that is if there is not any indiscretion
in the request. I will ask you to allow me to call upon you
and look over them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear old Friend</span>,&mdash;It is so long since I illustrated

highly pleased if you will visit my studio and take a peep at

that Dr. Sheldon Mackenzie alludes to of "The Life of a

Dickens was a little boy, and it is a chance if I ever see these

<p>I often wonder that some zealous collector does
not confine his attention solely to letters illustrated
by the writers. I have already mentioned the
achievements in this connection of Thackeray<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and
Sir Frank Lockwood. I have come across illustrated
letters in the correspondence of Sir Joshua Reynolds
and Mrs. Piozzi; Mrs. Norton embellished her letters
with admirable sketches of a humorous character, and
so did John Leech, Hablot K. Browne, Frederick
Barnard, and, of course, George Cruikshank. In my
three grangerised volumes relating to the history of
<i>Punch</i> are letters illustrated by Sir Francis Burnand
(who delighted his friends with this kind of <i>jeu
d'esprit</i> before he left Cambridge), Mr. G. A. Sala,
Mr. Linley Sambourne, Mr. H. Furniss, Mr. Phil May,
and Mr. E. T. Reed. One of the most curious illustrated
letters in my possession is a rough sketch of a
projected bath at Windsor, made by King George
III. for the benefit of Wyatt, the architect. Napoleon
often added sketch-plans of battles and movements of
troops to his letters, and Louis Philippe was fond of
making quaint drawings, which are sometimes to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
found even on the official documents which passed
through his hands. It was from a rough sketch in
a letter of Mr. Cobden, now in possession of Mr. T.
Fisher Unwin, that we find the genesis of the idea
of the "big" and "little loaf," which has achieved
something very like political immortality.</p>

(Napoleon).&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gourgaud</span>, p. 261.</p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> subjects of autograph collecting and autograph
dealing in France, as well as the wealth of French
literature dealing with the whole subject, and the
abundance of collections of facsimiles, have already
been incidentally alluded to. The business now
carried on by M. Noël Charavay was founded in
1843 by his father, M. Jacques Charavay, who died in
1867. He was succeeded by his son, Stephen
Charavay, who lived till 1899. At his funeral an
eloquent address was delivered by M. Anatole
France. Five years before the autograph business
had been made over by M. Stephen Charavay to his
brother, Noël Charavay, who now carries it on. In
1865 M. Gabriel Charavay, the brother of Jacques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
Charavay, acquired the goodwill and connection of
M. Laverdet, one of the earliest dealers in autographs.
His son and successor, Eugène, died young in 1892,
and the head of the house is now the widow of
Gabriel Charavay. Monthly catalogues are issued by
both firms under the respective titles of <i>Bulletin
d'Autographes</i> and <i>Revue des Autographes</i>. The first
publication is now (1910) in its 63rd, the other in
its 45th year. Autograph collectors would do
well to study both, as English letters are frequently
offered for sale in them, and the price of Napoleonic
MSS. and similar <i>rariora</i> is, as a rule, much less in
England than in France. I strongly recommend
beginners in autograph collecting to carefully read
the introduction to the fine Bovet catalogue, afterwards
published as a pamphlet by M. Stephen
Charavay. The four volumes, entitled "L'Isographie
des Hommes Célèbres," are of inestimable use in
acquiring familiarity with the handwriting of celebrated
French men and women. M. Jacques
Charavay and his sons are responsible as "experts"
(and in France autograph "experts" have an official
character) for the compilation of nearly the whole
of the elaborate catalogues of autograph sales
which have taken place in Paris since 1843.
The solitary exception to this assertion is the
sale of the MSS. of Madame Récamier. It was
Jacques Charavay and his two successors who

<p>Of Napoleon I. as a scribe my friend Dr. J.
Holland Rose writes me as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Napoleon was the greatest letter-writer of all time. The
number of letters written or dictated by him up to the end
of the Waterloo Campaign is 22,061; many more belong to the
subsequent period, and some 2,000 or 3,000 letters have been
found since the publication of the "Correspondance de
Napoléon," published by order of Napoleon III.</p>

<p>On very many occasions he wrote or dictated thirty or forty
letters and dispatches in one day. A well-known example of
his epistolary activity is that recorded by a Saxon Colonel, von
Odleben, who describes him while staying at Düben shortly
before the Battle of Leipsic, October, 1813. In those anxious
days Napoleon kept his secretaries on the watch day and night,
and is known to have sent off six important letters in the small
hours of October 12th, shortly before he set out for Leipsic.
In later days he wrote comparatively few of his letters
himself, simply because his writing was almost illegible.</p>

<p>His early letters to Josephine were of course in his own
handwriting; they are remarkable, among the love-letters of
great men, for their passionate ardour: which, however, soon
cooled under the frivolities and neglect of his Consort.</p>

<p>Some of his letters never have been deciphered. The
present writer has in his possession an excellent photograph
of a long Napoleon letter which is a rough draft of a proclamation
to his army after the great victory at Rivoli in
January, 1797. It has been much erased and altered. The
skill of experts at Paris and London has failed to decipher
the contents of three-fourths of this scrawl, yet the original
was sold recently for a very large sum of money.</p></div>

<p>I have already mentioned<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> the seven Napoleon
letters sold in London in 1904 for £350. In the
following year I was much interested in three letters
which M. Noël Charavay offered for sale at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
modest price of £100, throwing light on certain
negotiations between Bonaparte and the Bourbons,
which supplement a curt letter of the former in the
Morrison Collection declining to entertain certain
proposals. The three letters sold in 1905 are in the
easily recognisable handwriting of Louis XVIII.
(known in 1801, when they were written, as the Comte
de Lille), and in them he puts before the Abbé de
Montesquieu, who was acting as a go-between in
the matter, the reasons which should induce the First
Consul to facilitate the return of the descendant of
St. Louis to the throne of his forefathers. In the
first of the series (dated Warsaw, March 22, 1801)
Louis congratulates himself on the idea which has
prompted him to take the initiative in the matter.
He writes as follows: "Buonaparte is to-day the
greatest of our country's soldiers. He will be her
saviour. As the Father of the French it is for me
to make the first advance.... I charge you to
communicate to him the following arguments: the
restoration of the Monarchy is necessary; the existence
of the Republic has only proved its impossibility;
the only Republicans in France are abstract
reasoners, faddists, &amp;c." In a last and final memorandum
he says: "When I appeal to Buonaparte,
do I do so merely to march over the bodies of the
dead? If glory has chosen him to restore the
Monarchy, let glory be the witness of my engagements."
At the same time he energetically denies
the allegation that he has ever encouraged or
approved any project for the assassination of the
First Consul.</p>

<p>In February of the present year I saw in London
a superb Napoleonic letter of great historic importance,
and authenticated by a declaration made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
the Duke of Wellington. This letter once belonged
to an English Prime Minister. It was written on
May 1, 1803, when the delusive Treaty (or Truce) of
Amiens was about to be torn up. A part of the
letter has appeared, but I now give it <i>in extenso</i>
with a translation<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>I am in receipt of your letter which was given me at
Malmaison. I desire that the conference should not end in
idle words. Be cold in your demeanour&mdash;haughty and if need
be proud. If the note contains the word ultimatum, let him
feel that this word means war, and that this manner of
negotiating is that of a superior to an inferior; if the note
does not contain this word see that he uses it saying that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
must really know where we are, that we are weary of this state
of tension and that they will never obtain from us, what they
obtained in the last years of the Bourbons, that we are no
longer the people to receive a Commissioner at Dunkirk
and that the ultimatum once delivered everything will
be broken off. Frighten him as to the consequence of this
act on his part, if he is unwavering take him to your drawing-room
and as he is on the point of leaving say to him "But the
Cape and the Isle of Gorée, are they evacuated?" Then
towards the end of the interview tone down matters a little,
and suggest his coming back before writing to his Court, so
that you may be able to tell him the impression which the
conference has made upon me, and that it could be softened
by the assurance of the evacuation of these places.</p>

<p>Of the various autographs of Napoleon in my own
collection, the earliest (now reproduced) is dated
February 1, 1796. Napoleon then signed himself
"Buonaparte." He was then Commander-in-Chief of
the Army of the Interior. The last I possess consist
of a note in pencil written at St. Helena and the
various hieroglyphics with which he controlled the
entries in Pierron's journal of household disbursements.
All the autographs of the Bonaparte family
fetch high prices, especially letters of Madame Mère
(Napoleon's mother), Josephine and Marie Louise
(his wives), and the sisters Eliza, Pauline, and
Caroline. Letters of his father are now extremely
difficult to obtain, although ten years ago they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
fetched only from £1 to £2. Letters of Talleyrand
are not rare, but the one I now place before my

<p>In this letter, dated April 20, 1808, Talleyrand
conveys to the Emperor, then at Bayonne, his congratulations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
on the birth of the future Emperor,
Napoleon III., at which he was present, and it must
have been written the very day when that event took
place. In his "Life of Napoleon III.," at page 10,
the late Mr. Archibald Forbes writes thus: "It was
on the afternoon of April 20, 1808, in her <i>hôtel</i> in the
Rue Cérutti, now the banking-house of the Rothschilds
in the Rue Lafitte, that Queen Hortense gave
birth to her third son, the future Napoleon III. The
Empress was then at Bordeaux and the Emperor at
Bayonne. Talleyrand, with other high officers, had
been commanded by Napoleon to be present at the
impending accouchement of Queen Hortense. She
thus notes regarding him: 'The visit of M. de
Talleyrand aggravated my nervous state. He
constantly wore powder, the scent of which was so
strong that when he approached me I was nearly
suffocated.' Talleyrand looked down solemnly on
the new-born infant; some thirty years later, in Lady
Tankerville's drawing-room in London, he did not
choose to recognise the son of Hortense. The heir
of the Empire was then an exile, and Talleyrand
was serving a new master."</p>

<p>I possess letters and documents signed by
Napoleon in Egypt (1798-99), at Rambouillet
(1807), at Bayonne (1808), and on a pardon (1812).
Possibly the finest is on a letter written in 1805 from
the camp at Boulogne. I paid £5 for this; it is
worth at least five times as much now. Letters of
most of Napoleon's Marshals vary in value from 10s.
to 20s. The rarest are those of Desaix (killed at
Marengo) and Poniatowski (drowned in the Elster
in 1813). They are worth from £3 to £5. An
autograph letter of the Duc d'Enghien would
probably bring its owner £20. I gave £5 for a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>

<p>Autograph letters of the Prince Imperial fetch
very high prices indeed&mdash;anything from £5 upwards.
The fine essay written by him at the Royal Military
College, Woolwich, is worth quite twice that sum.</p>

<p>Letters of the Empress Eugénie are now generally
priced higher than those of her husband, and I have
known as much as £10 asked for one. Her Majesty
is, or was, a zealous collector of autographs. Twenty
years ago she was credited with possessing several
letters of Catherine of Aragon, and a letter from
Henry VII. to King and Queen Ferdinand and
Isabella, of the highest historical importance.</p>

<p>Fine letters of Louis XVIII., Charles X., and Louis
Philippe can be obtained for a pound or less, and
the correspondence of the statesmen who served
under them is even cheaper. I gave 20 francs for
a very confidential letter written to the last-named
monarch by Count Molé (1781-1853) in July, 1835.
It begins thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Sire</span>,&mdash;His Majesty will probably recollect that by means
of a little monthly arrangement I have very nearly silenced
the grape-shot of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, obtaining occasionally

<p>The official letters of the Revolutionary and
Napoleonic periods are often distinguished by
engraved vignettes of great artistic beauty. The
designs of the earlier ones are often classical. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
letters of naval officers are often headed by a
medallion on which a Roman galley figures conspicuously.
It was by carefully studying the sale
catalogues that I obtained the letter of Talleyrand
to Napoleon at an outlay of 27 francs. For 52 francs
I purchased in the open market one of the earliest
official letters of Villeneuve to the Minister of
Marine at Paris, after the battle of the Nile.</p>

<p>Some of the autographs of the Revolution fetch
very high prices. Letters of Mirabeau are comparatively
cheap, but those of the Robespierres and
Anacharsis Cloots command almost as much as
those of Montesquieu. Letters of Madame Roland
and Marat are also much in request. Autographs of
Charlotte Corday are probably more valuable than
those of Marie Antoinette.</p>

<p>In the early part of the nineteenth century MSS.
of every description were sold at prices which now
seem incredible. Miss Berry tells us that the
"Deffand collection of letters and documents consisting
of 1 folio of <i>&#339;uvres de</i> Boufflers; 1 do. of
letters from different persons; 2 do. of letters from
Voltaire to Madame de Deffand; 1 do. Journal of
do.; 1 do. <i>divers ouvrages</i> of do.; 5 large bundles
of manuscript papers; 1 packet containing several
hundred letters from Voltaire, Rousseau, Delille,
Montesquieu, de Staël, Walpole, Henault, and 7
<i>large packets</i> containing 800 letters from Madame de
Deffand to Horace Walpole were sold in one lot
to Dyce Sombre for £157." Lucky Nabob! I may
say without indiscretion that the single letter from
Napoleon to Talleyrand mentioned at the opening of
this chapter obtained a better price. Letters of
Voltaire are worth from £1 to £5 each. I gave
10 francs for the apothecary's account for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>

<p>It is needless to discuss the value of such priceless
treasures as the autographs of Rabelais and Molière,
the subjects of so much discussion and (if truth be
told) so much deception. Like the signatures of
Shakespeare, they may be described as the Koh-i-noors
of calligraphy. They do not come within the
domain of practical autograph collecting.</p>

<p>"How very inconsiderate some of our great people have
been in the matter of epistolary correspondence! If Thomas
Lynch, jun., and Button Gwinnett, and John Morton had only
understood the feelings of a collector, they would surely have
favoured their friends more frequently with an A.L.S. or
even an A.N.S. When they were signing the Declaration on
that warm July afternoon, and committing themselves to the
famous fallacy that 'all men are created equal,' they might
have foreseen the day when every American collector would
begin his colligendering career by gathering 'signers.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Adrian

be fairly claimed by the country of their birth, the
majority of their most ardent and enthusiastic successors
are to be found to-day on the other side of
the Atlantic. It is in New York, Boston, Baltimore,
Philadelphia, San Francisco, St. Louis, Savannah,
and elsewhere that one must now look for many
of the choicest and most priceless literary MSS. in
existence, and it is obvious that the New World has
in a measure become the guardian of many of the
traditions and treasures of the Old. Before me lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>
the calendar of the Emmet collection of papers
relating to American history, presented some ten
years ago to the New York Public Library, which
fills no less than 563 closely printed pages; next to
it is the catalogue, in three parts, of the Louis
J. Haber collection, sold in December, 1909, by
the Anderson Auction Company of New York, the
successors of the historic firm of Bangs; the monograph,
"Privately Illustrated Books," by Daniel M.
Tredwell, of New York&mdash;the largest and most carefully
written book on the subject yet produced in
America (475 pages, handsomely printed in De
Vinne's best style), the exhaustive catalogue of that
treasure-house of Southern history, beneath the
laurel and jasmines of historic "Wormsloe," Georgia,
recently sent me by Wimberley J. De Renne;
the already often-referred-to "Meditations" of Mr.
Adrian H. Joline; the standard American book,
"Autographic Collections of the Signers of the
Declaration of Independence and the Constitution,"
by the late Lyman C. Draper, LL.D., the interesting
MSS. so carefully arranged by Chas. De F. Burns,
of New York, whose knowledge of early American
collecting is very great; and, last but not least, a
pile of valuable notes and statistics from the pen
of my excellent friend Mr. Telamon Cuyler, without
whose aid the present chapter could never have
been written. My initial difficulty is a plethora of
interesting information. I must not even attempt to
summarise the autographic trophies to be found in
such famous libraries as those of Mr. Pierpont Morgan,
Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet (at the present moment the
Nestor of the world's great collectors of MSS.), Mr.
W. J. De Renne of Wormsloe, or Mr. W. H. Bexby
of St. Louis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">{321}</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Emmet, now the most vigorous octogenarian
in New York, and divided only by a single generation
from the Irish patriot of 1804 (his uncle),
forms a living link between the days of Israel K.
Tefft of Savannah, the pioneer of American autograph
collecting, whose library was sold half a
century ago in Philadelphia, and men like Mr.
Louis J. Haber, Mr. Bexby, and Mr. Telamon Cuyler
himself; for is not my enthusiastic <i>confrère</i> himself
the proud possessor of a holograph document containing
seven times the name of Button Gwinnett?
To nine-tenths of my lay readers the mention of
B. Gwinnett, who was killed in a duel in May, 1777,
and T. Lynch, drowned at sea in the same fateful
year, will probably have no particular signification.
Let me tell them that if they could discover a fine
autograph letter, duly signed, of either of these
signers of the Declaration of American Independence,
they may consider themselves provided for for life,
and far richer than the owners of red and blue
"Post Office Mauritius," "Hawaian blues," or other
priceless <i>rariora</i> dear to the votaries of philately!</p>

<p>The great majority of American autograph
collectors apparently utilise their letters and documents
for the purposes of extra-illustration, or the
creation of "association-books."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Although the
arrangement of autographs on these lines does not
receive the whole-hearted sanction of Mr. Joline,
Dr. Emmet has successfully demonstrated the
supreme importance of this source of illustration to
the "grangeriser," and it is constantly practised by
both Mr. Cuyler and myself. In this connection I do
not, of course, allude to the MSS. of famous authors,
which should obviously be kept apart, and bound by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
experts like Mr. Cedric Chivers, in such a way as not
to interfere with their original condition or appearance,
but to isolated letters or documents. I fail to
imagine anything more interesting or attractive than
a copy of Clarendon's "History," illustrated not only
by portraits and views, but by MSS. like those in the
possession of Mr. Sabin, or those I shall describe
when giving some account of the sales of the last
decade.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Then, and then only, do you seem to
actually live again in the veritable atmosphere of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</p>

<p>The American collector generally begins his career,
both as an autograph collector and extra-illustrator,
by dealing with such works as Sanderson's "Lives of
the Signers of the Declaration of Independence"
and Lossing's "Field-book of the Revolution"
(1776-1783). The Emmet Collection in the New
York Public Library,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> which numbers 10,800 documents,
is classified under such heads as the Albany
Congress of 1754, the Stamp-Act Congress of 1765,
the Continental Congress of 1774, the members of
the Continental Congress, 1774-1789, Presidents of
Congress, Presidents of the United States, the
Signers of the Declaration of Independence, and so
forth.</p>

<p>The cult of the Signers is one of the most distinctive
features of American autograph collecting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span><a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
The late Dr. Raffles, of Liverpool, is credited with
having got together a complete series, and I have
heard the subject attracted the sympathetic interest of
Queen Victoria. While the Rev. Dr. Wm. B. Sprague
(born at Andover, Conn., U.S.A.) was the first man
to form the first unbroken set of the immortal fifty-six
"Signers," Dr. Raffles' set was the second to be
completed. This fact is shown in a letter of June,
1835, by Benjamin B. Thatcher (born at Warren, Me.,
1809; died Boston, Mass., 1840), the earliest writer
on American autograph collections. Some of the
signatures of the "Signers" are common enough,
but those of Button Gwinnett and Lynch, both of
which I am able, thanks to the kindness of Mr.
Cuyler, to illustrate, are of quite phenomenal rarity.
Gwinnett and Lynch both died tragically "before
their time," and this may possibly account for the
scarceness of their handwriting. Some collectors
spend their lives in the perpetual quest of these
unfindable autographs.</p>

<p>Mr. Cuyler has sent me several anecdotes on the
subject of these Gwinnett and Lynch signatures. He
informs me that the earliest American collector,
Israel K. Tefft, was called from Savannah to the
estate of a gentleman resident near that city. Having
to wait, he wandered on the lawn, under the cypress
and the jasmine, and, perceiving a scrap of paper
blowing about, he carelessly picked it up. To his
joyous astonishment he found that it was a draft
on the Treasury of Georgia, dated 1777, ordering
certain payments, and signed by Button Gwinnett!
Though Mr. Tefft was the first autograph collector in
America, and had begun operations as early as 1815-20,
in Savannah, he had, until that tour, never even
seen the signature of Button Gwinnett&mdash;other than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
that appearing upon facsimiles of the Declaration of
Independence. After transacting his business, he
exhibited his find to his client, and said that he
would gladly take the paper in place of money for
his services. The gentleman generously presented
him with the paper and also paid him. (This signature
of B. G. is now preserved in the "Set of Signers"
in the State Library at Albany, New York, U.S.A.)</p>

<p>Mr. Cuyler has ascertained that there are only
twenty-two known signatures of Button Gwinnett
extant. These include his holograph will, drawn up
a few hours before his fatal duel with Gen. McIntosh
(May, 1777), which is now in the collection of Mr.
J. Pierpont Morgan, of New York. No A.L.S. of
Gwinnett is known. The State of Georgia, in which
he was Master of Pilotage, Justice of the Peace,
Member of the Provincial Assembly, Member of
Council of Safety, and Governor, possesses not a
line of his writing. One L.S. is in the <i>private</i> collection
of Thos. Addis Emmet, M.D., of New York.</p>

<p>I have previously alluded to the holograph
document, with his name repeated seven times, in
possession of Mr. Cuyler. The A.L.S. of Thomas
Lynch, jun., "Signer for South Carolina" (now published),
came from the Washington correspondence.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
It was ultimately sold for £1,400 (<i>i.e.</i>, £370 more
than the record Nelson letter), and is the only one in
existence. It now figures in Dr. Emmet's best set
of "Signers" in the New York Public Library. In
this set fifty-five out of the fifty-six signers of the
American Magna Charta are represented by signed
holograph letters. Dr. Emmet regards the acquisition
of a letter signed by Gwinnett as the crowning
triumph of his sixty years' work in the fields of autograph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
collecting. If a holograph letter of Gwinnett
could be discovered, <i>and such a letter may very likely
exist in England</i>, it would probably fetch £5,000.</p>

<p>Gwinnett was an Englishman, a descendant of
Admiral Sir Thomas Button (who entered our navy
in 1589, explored Hudson's Bay, and died in 1634),
migrated early in life to Charleston, South Carolina,
finally settling in Georgia, where he accumulated
wealth. After his tragic death, his widow and only
child, a daughter, returned to England. The daughter
married but died childless.</p>

<p>In the list of American collectors Dr. Sprague
comes next to Mr. Tefft. George Washington at
his death left his correspondence neatly arranged and
filed. His widow, however, burned the whole of the
letters she had ever received from the first President
of the United States! This is almost the greatest
known destruction of valuable autograph matter.
From his first love-letter, penned in Virginia, to the
young Widow Custis, his correspondence during
the fatal Braddock campaign, his homely domestic
instructions to the <i>châtelaine</i> of Mount Vernon,
to his war letters, in which he opened his heart
and there recorded the true history of the American
War, she had preserved all, which now went into the
fire and £100,000 on to-day's valuation, and priceless
American historical data, went up in smoke!</p>

<div class="caption"><p class='center'>THE SIGNATURE AND WRITING OF BUTTON GWINNETT, THE RAREST AUTOGRAPH OF THE "SIGNERS."</p></div>
</div>

<p>By the unwise permission of the Washington
family, Dr. Sprague was permitted to abstract "as
many letters as he liked" from the wonderfully
accurate letter-files of George Washington, preserved
at his home, "Mount Vernon," in Virginia. Dr. S.
there got some of his best papers, being only requested
to "leave copies of all letters he took"!
Among the papers he thus acquired was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">{327}</a></span>
A.L.S. of Thomas Lynch, jun., "Signer" for South
Carolina.</p>

Country, could have led him into this measure. I shall
say nothing of his Abilities, convinced as I am that your

cannot fail to have, will soon discover them, but as to
Principles, I will be bold to say, that no Man living has

<p>Letters of George Washington often find their
way into the English sale-rooms. During the first
decade of the present century they have varied in
price from £6 to £60. Mr. Cuyler enables me to
give my readers not only one of the finest letters of
Washington's in existence, but one hitherto unpublished.
I need not point out either its characteristic
style or historic value, but will only observe that
Lund Washington, his cousin and manager of his
Virginia estates, possessed his confidence before any
other person, excepting perhaps Mrs. Washington.</p>

<i><span class="smcap">Camp at Cambridge</span> Augt 20th 1775</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Lund</span>,&mdash;Your Letter by Captn Prince came to my
hands last night&mdash;I was glad to learn by it that all are well.&mdash;the
acct given of the behaviour of the Scotchmen at Port
Tobacco &amp; Piscataway surpriz'd &amp; vexed me&mdash;Why did
they Imbark in the Cause?&mdash;What do they say for themselves?&mdash;What
does other say of them?&mdash;are they admitted
into company?&mdash;or kicked out of it?&mdash;What does their
Countrymen urge in justification of them?&mdash;they are fertile in
invention, and will offer excuses where excuses can be made.
I cannot say but I am curious to learn the reasons why men,
who had subscribed, and bound themselves to each other,
and their Country, to stand forth in defence of it, should
lay down their Arms the first moment they were called upon.</p>

<p>Although I never hear of the Mill under the direction
of Simpson, without a degree of warmth &amp; vexation at
his extreame stupidity, yet, if you can spare money from
other purposes, I could wish to have it sent to him, that
it may, if possible, be set a going before the works get
ruined &amp; spoilt, &amp; my whole Money perhaps totally
lost.&mdash;If I am really to loose Barran's debt to me, it will
be a pretty severe stroke upon the back of Adams, &amp;
the expense I am led into by that confounded fellow
Simpson, and necessarily so&mdash;in seating my Lands under the
management of Cleveland.&mdash;</p>

<p>Spinning should go forward with all possible dispatch,
as we shall have nothing else to depend upon if these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
disputes continue another year.&mdash;I can hardly think that
Lord Dunmore can act so low, and unmanly a part, as
think of seizing Mrs. Washington by way of revenge upon
me; howevr as I suppose she is, before this time gone
over to Mr Calverts, &amp; will soon after retug, go down to
New Kent, she will be out of his reach for 2 or 3 months
to come, in which time matters may, and probably will,
take such a turn as to render her removal either absolutely
necessary, or quite useless.&mdash;I am nevertheless exceedingly
thankful to the Gentlemen of Alexandria for their friendly
attention to this point and desire you will if there is any
sort of reason to suspect a thing of this kind provide a
Kitchen for her in Alexandria, or some other place of safety
elsewhere for her and my Papers.</p>

<p>The People of this Government have obtained a character
which they by no means deserved&mdash;their officers generally
speaking are the most indyferent kind of People I ever
saw.&mdash;I have already broke one Col. and five Captains
for Cowardice, and for drawing more Pay and Provisions
than they had men in their Companies there is two more
Cols now under arrest, and to be tried for the same offences&mdash;in
short they are by no means such Troops, in any respect
as you are led to believe of them from the accts which
are published, but I need not make myself Enemies among
them, by this declaration although it is consistant with
truth.&mdash;I daresay the men would fight very well (if properly
officered) although they are an exceeding dirty &amp; hasty
people.&mdash;had they been properly conducted at Bunkers
Hill (on the 17th of June) or those that were there properly
supported, the Regulars would have met with a shameful
defeat, &amp; a much more considerable loss than they did,
which is now known to be exactly 1057 killed &amp; wounded&mdash;it
was for their behaviour on that occasion that the above
officers were broke, for I never spared one that was accused
of Cowardice but brot'em to immediate Tryal.</p>

<p>Our Lines of Defence are now compleated, as near so
at least as can be&mdash;we men wish them to come out as
soon as they please, but they (that is the enemy) discover
no Inclination to quit their own Works of Defence, &amp;
as it is almost impossible for us to get to them, we do
nothing but watch each others motions all day at the
distance of about a mile, every now and then picking off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">{331}</a></span>
a stragler when we can catch them without their Intrenchments,
in return they often attempt to Cannonad our Lines
to no other purpose than the waste of a considerable
quantity of powder to themselves which we should be very
glad to get.&mdash;</p>

<p>What does Doctr Craik say to the behaviour of his
Countrymen, &amp; Townspeople? Remember me kindly to
him &amp; tell him that I should be very glad to see him
here if there was any thing worth his acceptance, but the
Massachusets People suffer nothing to go by them that they
can lay hands upon.&mdash;</p>

<p>I wish the money could be had from Hill &amp; the Bills of
Exchange (except Col Fairfax's, which ought to be sent to
him immediately) turned into Cash, you might then, I should
think, be able to furnish Simpson with about £300, but you are
to recollect that I have got Cleveland &amp; the hired People with
him to pay also.&mdash;I would not have you buy a single bushel of
wheat till you can see with some kind of certainty what
Market the Flour is to go to&mdash;&amp; if you cannot find sufficient
employment in repairing the Mill works, and other things of
this kind for Mr. Robets and Thomas Alferd, they must be
closely employed in making Cask or working at the Carpenters
or other business otherwise they must be discharged for it is
not reasonable, as all Mill business will probably be at an end
for a while, that I am to pay them £100 a year to be Idle.&mdash;I
should think Roberts himself must see, &amp; be sensible of the
reasonableness of this request, as I believe few Millers will
find employment if our Ports are shut up, &amp; the wheat kept
in the straw, or otherwise for greater security.</p>

<p>I will write to Mr. Milnor to forward you a good Country
Boulting Cloth for Simpson which endeavour to have contrived
to him by the first safe conveyance.&mdash;I wish you would
quicken Lasphire &amp; Sears about the Dining Room Chimney
Piece (to be executed as mentioned in one of my last letters)
as I could wish to have that end of the house compleatly
finished before I return.&mdash;I wish you had done the end of the
New Kitchen next the garden as also the old Kitchen with
Rusticated Board, however as it is not I would have the
corners done so in the manner of our New Church (those two
especially which Fronts the Quarter.&mdash;What have you done
with the Well? Is that walled up?&mdash;have you any accts of the
Painter? how does he behave at Fredericksburg?&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">{332}</a></span></p>

<p>I much approve of your sowing wheat in clean ground,
although you should be late in doing it, and if for no other
purpose than a tryal.&mdash;It is a growing I find, as well as a new
practice, that of Overseers keeping Horses, &amp; for what purpose,
unless it be to make fat Horses at my expense, I know
not as it is no saving of my own Horses. I do not like the
custom, &amp; wish you would break it, but do as you will, as I
cannot pretend to interfere at this distance.</p>

W. J. De Renne, and Elliot Danforth, are, like those
of Emmet, J. Pierpont Morgan, and Joline, familiar
to all American autograph collectors. I find in <i>The
Archivist</i> (1894) many interesting details of the
wonderful collection of Mr. George Washington
Childs, publisher and proprietor of the <i>Philadelphia
Ledger</i>. Mr. Childs acquired amongst other <i>rariora</i>,
the MSS. of Byron's "Bride of Abydos,"
Thackeray's "Lecture on the Four Georges," and
Scott's "Chronicles of Canongate." He possessed a
MS. parody by Byron on Wordsworth's "Peter Bell,"
which began with the somewhat prosaic lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There's something in a flying horse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And something in a huge balloon.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Byron wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There's something in a stupid ass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And something in a heavy dunce;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never since I went to school<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard or saw so d&mdash;&mdash;d a fool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As William Wordsworth is for once.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Amongst the autographs greatly sought after in
America is that of the ill-fated Major André. One
of the gems of Mr. Childs's collection is described as
a holograph poem by the unlucky soldier, entitled
the "Cow Chase," and dated July 21, 1780. Its
closing stanza runs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now I've closed my epic strain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I tremble as I show it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest this same warrior-drover Wayne<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Should ever catch the poet.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>André was soon after captured and executed. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
the concluding verse some unkind and unknown
hand has added the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And when the epic strain was sung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poet by the neck was hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to his cost he finds too late<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The "dung born tribe" decides his fate.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Cuyler sends me some interesting information
on the subject of André from the collector's point of
view. It appears that André was twice captured
during the American War. Upon the first occasion
he was hastily searched, and though he lost
his watch, arms, sword, and purse, he managed to
save the framed miniature of his beloved Honora
Sneyd by concealing it in his mouth! The occasion
of his second capture was on that fatal ride
along the east bank of the Hudson River, after his
interview with Benedict Arnold. At this time the
whole of André's papers, both official and personal,
were in New York. Upon the evacuation of
New York, 1783, some one took his papers to
Halifax, Nova Scotia. Seventy-five years later a
friend of Dr. Emmet called on a gentleman resident
there. Receiving no response to his ring, he walked
through the house, and as he entered the kitchen he
found his friend kicking the last of a heap of musty,
faded papers into the fire, on an open hearth. Leaping
over several great oaken chests, the visitor saved
seven or eight documents, several already scorched,
from the flames. The gentleman of Halifax explained
that he needed the chests, which his grandfather had
deposited in their garret, and so burned the papers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>
Those saved were autograph documents of André&mdash;and
the New Yorker gave them to Dr. Emmet, in
whose collection they now are. André's writings in
America are exceedingly scarce.</p>

<p>André was an artist, and executed several drawings
of his friends, among whom were portraits of
Abraham Cuyler and his wife, which are now preserved
in that family. This man was the last Royal
Mayor of Albany, New York, and the father of
General Sir Cornelius Cuyler, whose sons fought in
the Guards defending Hougomont at Waterloo.</p>

<p>As in France and England, there has been much
wanton destruction of MSS. in the United States,
on which subjects Mr. Joline speaks feelingly.
Mr. T. Cuyler tells me that after the crushing
defeat of the Federals by the Confederate Army
at Bull Run (First Manassas), Virginia, in 1861,
the former fled in wildest disorder to Washington
City, where they rallied. The consequent confusion,
the urgent demands for food and lodgings
for a large force of men, caused improvised
bakeries to be established in the lower story of the
National Capitol. A lady, in passing through a
corridor, observed an officer urging his men to roll
away into an adjacent marsh great barrels, dusty
and stained with age, out of which protruded ancient
papers. She paused, and thinking of Dr. Emmet's
collection, she begged leave to fill her pockets with
documents. Those which she so saved were found to
be priceless&mdash;being correspondence of 1776-1783, and
among her finds was a long letter from Benjamin
Franklin, dated at Passy, France, during the
American Revolutionary War. Later inquiries
disclosed the fact that, after the British victory
at Bladensburg, Maryland, the secretaries of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
Federal Government had hastily packed these
archives in barrels and carried them to safety before
the British forces had taken Washington City, in
the "War of 1812." Upon their return, these precious
papers had been left in the Capitol until ruthlessly
tossed out in 1861.</p>

<p>One of the most striking features in American
autograph collecting, important and extensive as
it is to-day, is the smallness of its beginnings. Tefft,
the originator of the autograph cult, who commenced
operations by securing a few signatures in the year
of Waterloo, was only a bank-cashier; Dr. Sprague
was a clerical tutor in the Washington family, and
pure accident put unique opportunities in his way;
Ferdinand J. Dreer was a merchant who took up
the hobby when his health gave way, and lived to
complete a collection second only in importance
to that formed by Dr. Emmet. It was Dreer who,
at the expense of £200, recovered Washington's last
letter, after it had remained for nearly a century
in Sweden. Charles C. Jones, jun., of Augusta,
Georgia, was the first to set the fashion of looking
for letters connected with the Civil War of 1861-65.
The era of autograph sales began in 1810, at
Charleston, South Carolina, by the dispersal of the
collection of MSS. formed by a French Consul, but
the first autograph sale catalogue is nearly a quarter
of a century later, and includes the papers of Aaron
Burr, at one time Vice-President of the United
States. It was not, however, till the "eighteen-fifties"
that dealing in autographs came to rank
as a business.</p>

<p>As regards the prospects of this popular pursuit
in the United States, Mr. Telamon Cuyler writes
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">{339}</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The future of American autograph collecting seems to be
directed to the illustration of the beginnings of our industrial
and financial life rather than to the forming or attempting to
form what would only result in being very inferior sets of
'Signers,' generals, governors, &amp;c. The beginnings of newspaper
life, of iron manufacturing, of cotton milling, of cotton
culture, of the steamboat business, of maritime life along the
Atlantic seaboard, and such efforts with special attention to
great inventions, such as the telephone, telegraph, typewriter,
electric light, automobile, flying machines, and many hundreds
of smaller discoveries. The gathering of documents connected
with the foundations of great industries, such as the steel
business, is now being carried forward by collectors of great
wealth who have drawn their immense fortunes from the
source which they endeavour to retrace to its petty beginning.
You can readily understand how perfectly natural such a
form of collecting appears when you view it in the light
of our national development and our national character.
I myself have taken up certain lines of collecting in this
field and which I find of the greatest interest."</p></div>

<p>Mr. C. E. Goodspeed, of 5<span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>, Park Street, Boston,
who, like Mr. Benjamin of New York, issues frequently
very useful sale catalogues of autograph
letters, also writes me:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I think the most interesting autograph which I have ever
had was a one-page quarto letter from Martha Washington
to Mrs. John Adams, the wife of the second President of the
U.S., in answer to Mrs. Adams' letter of condolence on the
death of her husband (President Washington). That letter
sold for $300.00, but would bring perhaps twice that to-day.
The most interesting historical document, perhaps, which
I have had was a letter from Governor Hutchinson to the
Committee of the town of Boston in answer to the demand
of the Committee for the removal of the troops. This was
written the day after the famous Boston Massacre of March
5, 1770. I have had a great many Washington letters, but
never any of great historical importance. An interesting
note might be made of those aggravating incidents where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">{340}</a></span>
autographs are brought in by parties who wish to find their
value, but who would not sell them. Amongst items of this
class I may mention, having been brought in quite recently,
Benjamin Franklin's famous epitaph for his own tombstone,
written in his own autograph; it is found in all the "Lives of
Franklin"; an autograph album containing about a dozen
letters from Byron to Lady Blessington; a letter from Byron
to his wife, written after their separation, but never sent, as
Lady Blessington advised against it and retained the letter;
also in the same album three or four letters from Dickens to
Lady Blessington; two charming Thackeray letters followed
with pretty pen-and-ink sketches; an autograph poem of
Thackeray's; two autograph poems, each of Elizabeth Barrett
and Robert Browning; and poems of Landor, and others!
Was not that a nice little collection, and was it not an
aggravation not to be able to even make an offer on it?"</p></div>

<p>The President of the Anderson Auction Company
(12, East 46th Street, New York) has most obligingly
sent me a priced catalogue of the Haber Sale, already
more than once mentioned in these pages.</p>

<p>Mr. L. J. Haber has also given me the price at
which the letters sold were originally acquired. If
the reader bears in mind that five dollars represent
a pound he will easily be able to judge not only the
prices which now rule in the autograph market of
New York, but the rise in them which has taken
place in the past ten or twenty years. No list of this
kind has ever before appeared:&mdash;</p>

<p>The majority of the Haber MSS. are of British
origin. It gives me little opportunity of saying anything
about the varying prices of the A.L.S. of
American Presidents, or of the rise in value of the
letters of Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant. I
note, however, that a letter of E. A. Poe has more
than trebled in value since Mr. Haber acquired it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">{343}</a></span>
Letters of Longfellow are still in demand, but those
of O. W. Holmes are somewhat at a discount and
were not largely represented in the Haber Sale, at
which a fine specimen of Benjamin Jowett went for
4s. A 4-pp. letter of Mr. Thomas Hardy was sold
for £1 19s., but a 1-p. 8vo of Rudyard Kipling
brought £3 8s.! A verse by Mr. Andrew Lang, to
which his signature was appended, went for £1 4s.
It was entitled "The Optimism of an Undertaker,"
and ran:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Twelve lines by Alexander Pope excited keen
competition, and were sold eventually for £29. It is
evident that, in spite of the set back of two years
ago which brought a good many autographs back
to England, the American market is still higher
than any other, and there is every chance of its
continuing so. On April 25, 1910, Mr. Frank Sabin
paid £8,650 at Sotheby's for the voluminous correspondence,
chiefly addressed to W. Blathwayt,
Secretary of State and Commissioner for Trade and
Plantations, relative to the American Colonies, during
the last quarter of the seventeenth century. William
Blathwayt (1649-1717) served his political apprenticeship
under Sir W. Temple, subsequently filling the
posts of Secretary at War (1683), Secretary of State
to William III. during the campaign in Flanders,
Commissioner for Trade and Plantations and Clerk
of the Privy Council. Some years ago a parcel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">{344}</a></span>
Blathwayt's own letters, which I used in extra-illustrating
the "Account of William III.'s Achievements
at the Siege of Namur," cost me 20s. Another
interesting lot at the sale of April 25th consisted
of thirteen MS. and thirty-five early printed maps.
This went to Mr. Quaritch for £690&mdash;a price solely
attributable to its unique American interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Upcott</span>, the conscript father of modern
autograph-collecting, was born in 1770, and lived
until 1845. He was the natural son of the painter
Ozias Humphry, the maiden-name of whose
mother he assumed. His own mother was Dolly
Wickens, the daughter of an Oxford tradesman.
From his father he inherited a taste for antiques
of every description, as well as a valuable collection
of miniatures, pictures, and engravings. The
life-story of Upcott is told with unusual detail in
the "Dictionary of National Biography."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> While
acting as an assistant to the well-known booksellers,
Evans of Pall Mall and Wright of Piccadilly, he
attracted the attention of Dean Ireland and other
<i>literati</i>. He was appointed Assistant-Secretary to
Porson at the London Institution in 1806, and on his
death continued to occupy the same post under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">{348}</a></span>
Maltby. Mr. H. R. Tedder tells us that "every inch
of the walls in his rooms, whether at the London
Institution or in his subsequent residence, was covered
with paintings, drawings, and prints, most of them
by Gainsborough or Humphry, while all the drawers,
shelves, boxes, and cupboards were crammed with his
[autograph] collections." Upcott spent the evening
of his useful life at 102, Upper Street, Islington,
naming his house "Autograph Cottage." In 1836
he published privately a catalogue of his MSS. One
of his greatest finds (and they may be counted by
scores) was the discovery of the MS. of Chatterton's
"Amphitryon" (now in the British Museum) in a
cheesemonger's shop. He never married. There
is a capital portrait of Upcott engraved in March,
1818, by T. Bragg, after a drawing by W. Behnes.
My copy of it is inscribed in minute but peculiarly
clear handwriting, "Presented to his much esteemed
Friend and fellow-traveller Mrs. Robert Nasmyth of
Edinburgh. William Upcott," London Institution,
August 26, 1833. By his side is a cabinet of medals;
in his hands a volume of "Topography," and on the
table a deed on which one at once recognises the
sign-manual of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>It is impossible to over-estimate the value of the
work done by Upcott in providing sources of reliable
information for future generations of historians. In
my own collection is the following interesting letter
of this collector, written nine years before his death:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'>
<span class="smcap mr2">Autograph Cottage, Upper St, Islington</span><br />
<i>Sep 19 1836</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;When you favoured me with a visit to take a
hasty glance at my collection of autographs I was much
pleased to find that you were gratified by the inspection. I
expressed a wish, which I still entertain, that this collection&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">{349}</a></span>
labour of more than 25 years&mdash;should be placed in the
hands of those who could appreciate its value either in a
Public Library, or with a private individual of acknowledged
taste.</p>

<p>At present, it remains in the same state as when you saw
it, nor am I desirous to accede to its removal from my
shelves until you shall again repeat your visit, agreeably to
your promise.</p>

<p>When may I expect that gratification? Should you deem
the mass, as particularized in my printed catalogue, too
voluminous to purchase, what say you with possession of the
13 volumes in folio <i>not</i> noticed in my catalogue containing
2078 Autographs including Letters and illustrated with 1000
portraits with Short Biographical notices, subjoined, written by
myself and bound by Herring in morocco with leather joints.
Their contents comprise Sovereigns, Statesmen, Divines,
Lawyers, Noble and Military Officers, Medical men, Authors,
Men of Science, Artists, Actors, Musicians, Foreigners and
celebrated Women with property; printed Title pages and
Indexes.</p>

<p>All the Autographs are mounted on tinted drawing paper
and those who have examined the drawings pronounce them
to be altogether unique. The collecting and writing of
the Memoirs cost me 3 years' labour. When my friend
Dawson Turner inspected them in 1830 he furnished me
with his opinion of its merits of which the following
is a copy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Upcott</span>,&mdash;You asked me as to the value of the
13 volumes of Autographs and I should be glad that, if you
are disposed to sell them, I might be allowed to place a price
upon them for I have often examined them as you know very
carefully, and now think that nobody is much better able than
myself to esteem property of this description. Pass on a few
short years and these volumes will be one of the best Biographical
Records in existence.</p>

<p>Considered in the four-fold character which they derive
from the interest of the individuals they contain, the beauty
of the portraits the care you have taken in illustrating the
history of the parties and the exquisite beauty and taste with
which they are put together:&mdash;I certainly know no series of
the kind equally desirable, and I regard the whole as unquestionably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">{350}</a></span>
unique. Such is my idea of their merit, and their
price I should say should be <i>at least seven hundred pounds</i>.</p></div>

<p>I am a single man, without a relation possessing a corresponding
feeling with myself. My earnest desire therefore is
to see all my articles of vertu as well as Pictures, Drawings,
Autographs, and curiously Illustrated Books, pass from me to
other hands who can appreciate their works, <i>without</i> the
notoriety of a public sale. My friend Turner's valuation of
the 13 volumes just alluded to has, I find, been backed by
the opinion of other collectors, yet if you should entertain
the idea of possessing them <i>I will part with them for 500
Guineas</i>.</p>

<p>An early answer, stating when I shall be likely to see you
will be esteemed a favour, as my intention is to go to Paris for
a short time about the end of the month.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="mr6">Believe me to remain, dear Sir,</span><br />
<span class="mr4">Your ever faithful servant,</span><br />
<span class="smcap mr2">William Upcott.</span></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Did you mention to your friend my small collection
of Original Pictures? You kindly told me you would favour
me with his company. My best compliments were on Mr.
Lomax and Mr. Bentley, your travelling companions.</p></div>

<p>It was to his brother autograph collector, Mr. Dawson
Turner, of Yarmouth, that Upcott dedicated in
1818 his standard work on the literature of English
topography. Mr. Greaves, of Isham Hall, Manchester,
apparently missed the chance of a lifetime.
He might have acquired for £500 what would be
now worth £15,000 or even £20,000.</p>

<p>In 1846 Upcott's <i>rariora</i> were sold by Sotheby at
Evans's auction-rooms, 106, New Bond Street, and
realised £4,125 17s. 6d., and that at a time when
the science of autographs was in its infancy. In the
"Dictionary of National Biography" reference is made
to the large paper copy of the Upcott catalogue
now in the British Museum as once belonging to
Dawson Turner. Numerous purchases were made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">{351}</a></span>
for the national collection, which now form the
series known as additional MSS. 15841 to 15957.
Amongst these 116 volumes are the papers of John
Nicholas, the papers of Brown and Evelyn, Burton's
diary, Curtius's letters, the Dayrolles correspondence,
the letters addressed to Sir Christopher Hatton,
Shenstone's poem, the "Snuff-Box," and many other
items of extraordinary interest, including Prior's
papers while in Paris, and the papers of the French
Army in Italy.</p>

<p>The examination of this truly marvellous catalogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">{353}</a></span>
not only shows the extent of Mr. Graves's
loss, but that the increase of prices between 1827
and 1846 had been infinitesimal. The earliest indications
of a noteworthy upward movement are
discernible at the Donnadieu Sale of 1851, and still
more markedly so at the dispersal of the collections
of Mr. Young and Mr. Dillon in 1869. It was
reserved for the present year of grace to see a Keats
letter sell for £500, and one of Charlotte Brontë for
£50. My friend Dr. Scott is quite in despair over
the prices of February 28, 1910, and regards the
figure at which the Brontë autograph sold as "positively
wicked"!</p>

<p>One of the most industrious (but not always discriminating)
collectors who followed was Sir Thomas
Phillipps, of Cheltenham (1792-1872), who not unfrequently
acquired the whole contents of a dealer's
catalogue <i>en bloc</i>. Sales from the <i>Bibliotheca Phillippica</i>
have taken place at intervals since 1892, and
the store is not yet exhausted.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> I am personally
grateful to this voracious accumulator of autographic
treasure, as I picked up at one of the sales seven
volumes of eighteenth-century water-colour sketches
of Dorset buildings and scenery for&mdash;<i>five shillings!</i></p>

<p>In 1832 he wrote the following letter (now in my
possession) to the late Sir Henry Ellis:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='right'>
<i>February 16 1832</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You expressed a wish that I would consent to
part with my Library of MSS to the British Museum. It
cannot be expected that I should make a gift of them after
the enormous sum I have paid for them, but I am willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">{354}</a></span>
cede them, if the nation will pay my debts, which I now
owe. The number of MSS I consider to be above 8000 Vols,
containing probably 20,000 articles.</p>

<p class='right'>
<span class="mr4">Believe me to be yrs truly</span><br />
<span class="smcap mr2">Thos Phillipps</span></p>

<p>PS.&mdash;I must observe that the money thus paid, will not be
lost to the nation, while the manuscripts will be gained.</p></div>

<p>The priceless Morrison Collection has already been
mentioned. Its dispersal would certainly occasion
a dislocation in autograph prices throughout the
world.</p>

<p>Since 1900 I have carefully noted the prices
realised at all the principal sales in London, and
more recently in New York, and although there
has been a steady rise in prices for high-class
autographs, not a single sale has ever occurred at
which some bargain or other might not have been
picked up.</p>

<p>The existing firm of Sotheby, Wilkinson, &amp; Hodge,
of 13, Wellington Street, Strand (the premises, by
a strange coincidence, once occupied by the elder
Ireland), was really founded as far back as 1696,
when Messrs. Cooper &amp; Milling first began to dispose
of MSS.&mdash;generally in the evening. The business
passed successively through the hands of Messrs.
Ballard, Paterson, &amp; Baker. In 1744 Samuel Baker
moved to auction-rooms over "Exeter 'Change" in
the Strand. At the death of Mr. Baker he was
succeeded by Mr. John Sotheby, when the firm
became Leigh &amp; Sotheby. From 145, Strand, they
removed to the premises in Wellington Street, long
familiar to buyers of MSS.</p>

<p>There were several autograph sales at "Sotheby's"
in 1903. The late Mr. Frederick Barker was good
enough to price for me the catalogue of the sale of
June 23rd-24th. On the first day five long letters
of Samuel Richardson to the Rev. Mr. Lobb (1743-56)
averaged about £12 12s. A conveyance
signed by Guido Fawkes (reputed to have been
picked up for 10s.) fetched £101, and a 6½-pp. letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">{358}</a></span>
of Nelson to Sir Alexander Ball was sold for £30 10s.
Throughout this sale prices ruled very high&mdash;quite a
short note of Thackeray's realising £7 5s. A fine
series of letters by Earl St. Vincent averaged about
£2, but one of these (dated January 17, 1801), in
which he wrote: "Nelson was very low when he
came here, the day before yesterday, appeared and
acted as if he had done me an injury, and felt
apprehensive that I was acquainted with it. Poor
man! he is devoured with vanity, weakness and
folly, was strung with ribbons, medals, &amp;c., and yet
pretended he wished to avoid the honours and
ceremonies he everywhere met with on the road,"
brought no less than £9 5s. A number of letters by
Edward Fitzgerald, the translator of Omar Khayyám,
addressed to Joseph Fletcher ("Posh"), averaged
about 30s., and several letters of Charles Dickens
£2 2s. each.</p>

<p>The two-days' sale of June 8th and 9th in this
year brought no less than £1,963 9s. 6d. for only
618 lots.</p>

<p>The first autograph sale of 1904 in Wellington
Street lasted two days only (13th and 14th of May),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">{360}</a></span>
but it included No. 218, the A.L.S. of Nelson to Lady
Hamilton (September 25, 1805), 4 pp. 4to, which
realised £1,030, possibly still the record price for a
single letter. Other letters of Nelson at this sale
fetched £16, £13 (two), £6 15s., and £4 15s. A letter
of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, beginning with the
emphatic words, "Ay, ay, as you say my dear, men
are vile inconstant toads," was sold for 15s. only.
A great many letters of great interest were included
in this catalogue. Amongst them may be noted
A.L.S. Beethoven, £30; A.L.S. Sir Stamford Raffles,
nearly 25 pp. 4to, described as "giving a most lively
and interesting description of the interior description
of St. Helena with <i>Napoleon Buonaparte</i>, and
Napoleon's answers to certain charges commonly
brought against him, etc., <i>marked 'private,' probably
unpublished. Off St. Helena, May 20, 1816.</i>" This is
now in my collection.</p>

<p>It was at this sale that a letter of the Duke of
Wellington fetched the record price (as far as his
autographs are concerned) of £101. It was thus
described:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">127. Extremely interesting Letter written the day
after the Battle of Waterloo. Letters written at
this period by the Great Duke are extremely scarce.</span></p>

<p>Poor Canning had my small dispatch box in our battle
yesterday and when he was killed it was lost. I shall be very
much obliged to you if you will send me another of the same
size as the last with the same lock and key and leather cover,
&amp;c., as soon as possible. Let it have in it a small silver or
thick glass inkstand with one of Braham's patent penholders
and one of his pens. What do you think of the total defeat
of Buonaparte <span class="smcap">by the British Army</span>? Never was there in
the annals of the world so desperate or so hard fought an
action or such a defeat. It was really the battle of the Giants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">{361}</a></span>
My heart is broken by the terrible loss I have sustained of my
old friends and companions and my poor soldiers. I shall
not be satisfied with the battle however glorious if it does not
of itself put an end to Buonaparte.</p>

<p>This letter was written at 4 o'clock in the morning after the
battle.</p></div>

<p>The letter before it (126) realised only 8s., and two
letters sold together (128) after it, only 9s., although
both were excellent specimens of Wellington's
style.</p>

<p>There was another autograph sale at "Sotheby's"
on July 18th and 19th. In this sale the following
prices were obtained:&mdash;</p>

<p>By way of contrast the following letter of the late
Sir H. M. Stanley, addressed to the Secretary of the
Temple Club, realised only <i>one shilling</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I can assure you it is none the less welcome, on the
contrary when my eyes glance over the list of illustrious men
composing the Honorary Committee I am lost in admiration
of the brilliant prize I have so unexpectedly received. Where
Froude and Dickens, Dixon, Taylor, and Hood tread I am
only too conscious that very much greater men than myself
ought to be proud to follow.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">{362}</a></span></p>

<p>The following A.L.S. of Lady Hamilton's was sold
for £12 15s.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="ml2">
<span class="smcap">Clarges St.</span>, <i>May 8</i>, to:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Tyson</span>,&mdash;The long absence of our dearest
Nelson makes me apply to you. First I must tell you that
what money I had in my banker's hands, I have laid out at
Merton, and Lord Nelson thanked me in his last letter and
said he would settle with me with thanks when he came
home. Could you then my dearest Tyson either on my
account or Lord Nelson's lend me a hundred and fifty
pounds.</p></div>

<p>I lately saw, in possession of Mr. Sabin, Nelson's
private banker's pass-book during the last eighteen
months of his life. With two exceptions every
cheque he had drawn was in favour of his "dearest
Emma."</p>

<p>A one day's sale of 213 lots at "Sotheby's" on
December 1, 1904, brought £582 17s. An account
verified by Henry VII. with his royal initials
realised £10, and a document with sign-manual of
Henry VIII., £7 5s. A Privy Council letter from
Whitehall (April 27, 1640) was sold for £8 15s. A
series of official papers signed by Bonaparte averaged
£3, but a certificate of service signed by Captain
James Napoleon sold for more than twice as much.
One of the features of this sale was quite a number
of letters by Governors, Deputy-Governors, and
Judges in Australia. Many of these fetched £10
each. A letter of Colonel William Paterson to Sir
Joseph Banks (1805) went as high as £13 10s., and
one of David Collins, founder and first Governor of
the Van Diemen's Land Settlement, yielded the
same price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">{363}</a></span></p>

<p>This was followed by the sale of December 5th
and 6th, in which 4,116 lots brought £1,009 16s.
Nelson's letter-book (1796-97) was sold for £150.</p>

<p>A series of six holograph letters from Dr. Samuel
Johnson to his friend Sir Robert Chambers, afterwards
a judge in Bengal, all said to be unpublished,
and extending from October 22, 1762, to April 19,
1783, realised £125; the original galley and second
proof sheets of "The Impregnable Rock of Holy
Scripture," with numerous corrections and alterations
in the handwriting of Mr. Gladstone, £10 10s.; an
autograph letter of John Keats, June, 1819, to Miss
Jeffrey, in which he says, "You will judge of my
1819 temper when I tell you that the thing I
have most enjoyed this year has been writing an
'Ode to Indolence,'" 4 pp. 4to, £35 (Quaritch);
and the autograph manuscript of W. Morris's "A
King's Lesson, an Old Story Retold," on six leaves
of paper, £27 10s.</p>

<p>The second day's sale included a remarkable series
of autograph letters addressed to Mrs. Thrale and
inherited by a descendant. Sixteen of the letters
were written by Dr. Samuel Johnson, chiefly to Mrs.
Thrale; two were from Boswell to the same, and
there were others from Mrs. Siddons, Garrick, Goldsmith,
Burke, and various other celebrities of the
day. The Johnson letters for the most part
possessed but little literary interest, but in the
longest one in the series, written by Boswell and
dated from Banff, August 25, 1773, he refers to his
journey in Scotland, and says concerning their
arrival at St Andrews: "The professors who
happened to be resident in the vacation made a
public dinner and treated us very kindly and
respectfully. They showed us their colleges, in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">{364}</a></span>
of which there is a library that for luminousness and
elegance may vie with the new edifice at Streatham.
But learning seems not to prosper among them; one
of their colleges has been lately alienated, and one of
their churches lately deserted." The Johnson letters
date from July 19, 1755, to April 15, 1784, and the
entire series was sold <i>en bloc</i> for £300.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The sale
also included an interesting series of five autograph
letters from S. T. Coleridge to Thomas Poole,
1797-98, giving a history of his life, and covering
17 pages folio and quarto, which fetched £14 10s.,
and an autograph letter from Charles Lamb to
J. H. Green, August 26, 1834, which sold for
£6 2s. 6d.</p>

<p>Allusion has been made elsewhere to the excitement
caused at the beginning of 1905 by the sale of
January 25th, at which the 33 4to pages, described as

<p>From the 2nd to the 4th of March following there
was a three-days' autograph sale in Wellington Street,
in which 905 lots brought £1,834 9s. 6d. A series of
letters by General Gordon averaged £1 each; the
Dickens letters disposed of sold better than in 1903
or 1904, realising from £2 to £6, and 52 letters of
Gilbert White brought £150. Some splendid
musical and dramatic letters collected by the late
Mr. Julian Marshall realised high prices, showing a
marked advance in this kind of autographs.</p>

<p>The one-day sale of April 13, 1905, was almost
entirely devoted to Civil War and Royal autographs,
205 lots (in striking contrast to the Upcott Sale)
making a total of £2,009&mdash;or nearly £10 each lot!
Some of the rarest items fetched the following

<p>The late Mr. Frederick Barker showed me the
whole of this collection bound up in a shabby
looking volume, with small rope and thick glue!
The separating them without injury was a matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">{366}</a></span>
of the greatest difficulty, and the necessary operation
was performed at Oxford.</p>

<p>This was the centenary year of Trafalgar, and its
influence was soon felt in the autograph market.
The one-day sale at "Sotheby's" on May 17th
offered abundant attractions to Nelson buyers; but
the 226 lots only fetched £397 10s. The Nelson
items were somewhat over-catalogued, and the results
were probably disappointing. The highest price paid
for a Nelson letter was £25. Some went as low as
£3 3s. Nelson's captains fared badly. Letters of
Berry, Bickerton, Brereton, and so forth went for two
or three shillings each, and Ganteaume, Decrès, and
Gravina were equally unfortunate. An order signed
by Hardy, informing Admiral Berkeley that three
men had been lashed with the "cat-o'-nine-tails,"
was disposed of for 7s.</p>

<p>Far more important, however, was the sale of the
previous week (May 11th, 12th, and 13th), which
included the Bunbury MSS. In this sale 842 lots
fetched £2,108. The Bunbury correspondence was
quite as important to the story of the days of
George III. as the documents sold during the
previous month were to that of the Civil War. The
dispersal of both collections must ever be a matter of
regret. I do not think the Bunbury letters would
have been sold at all in 1910.</p>

<p>Before the Bunbury portion of the sale was reached
a series of twenty-four letters addressed by Mrs.
Siddons to Mrs. Pennington, chiefly relating to the
troubles occasioned by Thomas Lawrence's courtship
of her daughters,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> was disposed of. They belonged
to Mr. Oswald G. Knapp and realised £100. As
no letter of Sarah M. Siddons was included in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">{367}</a></span>
lot, I do not regret having acquired the letter
catalogued in error as that of her mother. The
letters of Mrs. Piozzi to Dr. Whalley (twenty-five
in all) published in the Rev. Hill Wickham's book
on his ancestor<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> were sold for £16. Mrs. Wickham
parted with them for £6, and got little more fifty
years ago for Dr. Whalley's correspondence with
Mrs. Siddons. Two letters of Burns brought £25
and £14 10s. respectively, and the buyer of the
letters written by Sir Thomas Noël Hill, K.C.B.,
during the campaign in the Peninsula and in
Flanders, possibly got a bargain. One Nelson
letter only was sold on May 11th. It was addressed
to Lady Hamilton from the <i>Victory</i>, on May 4, 1805,
and realised £71. In my opinion it was far finer
than that for which £1,030 was paid. It ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Your poor dear Nelson is my dearest beloved Emma very
very unwell, after a two years hard fag it has been mortifying
the not being able to get at the Enemy, as yet I can get no
information about them, at Lisbon this day week they knew
nothing about them but it is now generally believed that they
are gone to the West Indies. My movements must be guided
by the best Judgment I am able to form. John Bull may be
angry, but he never had any officer, who has served him more
faithfully, but Providence I rely will yet crown my never
failing exertions with success, and that it has only been a hard
trial of my fortitude in bearing up against untoward events.
You my own Emma are my first and last thoughts and to the
last moment of my breath, they will be occupied in leaving
you independent of the world, and all I long in the world that
you will be a kind and affectionate <i>Father</i> to my <i>dear</i> [a word
obliterated] <span class="smcap">daughter Horatia</span>, but my Emma your Nelson
is not the nearer being lost to you for taking care of you in
case of events which are only known when they are to happen
and an all wise Providence, and I hope for many years of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">{368}</a></span>
comfort with you, only think of all you wish me to say
and you may be assured it exceeds if possible your wishes.
May God protect you and <span class="smcap">my dear Horatia</span>, prays ever your
most faithful and affectionate</p>

<p class='right mr2'>
<span class="smcap">Nelson</span>.</p></div>

<p>The Bunbury MSS. were included in the lots from
607 to 842. Considering their great historical importance
the total price paid for them&mdash;£896 19s.&mdash;can
hardly be considered adequate. The Crabbe
A.L.S. to Burke (6 pp. 4to), for which I subsequently
gave £20, went for £14. Some very important
letters of General Dumouriez were sold for £6 10s.
and £6 5s., and C. J. Fox's confidential letters to his
brother, General Fox, averaged less than £3.</p>

<p>Some important A.L.S. and L.S. of Frederick the
Great brought from £6 to £20, and a letter from
Oliver Goldsmith to Mrs. Bunbury, partly in verse
and extremely witty, was cheap at £82, although it
made a record as far as Goldsmith's letter is concerned.
Another Goldsmith letter to H. W. Bunbury
about his "last literary effort" ("She Stoops to
Conquer"), fetched only £50. The letters of the
third Lord Holland (1773-1840) went for a song,
although every page of them would materially help
the historian. The finest letter of Sir Hudson Lowe
was sold for £15, and three letters from Pope to
Lord Strafford realised £29 10s., £12, and £8 15s.
respectively. Ten letters of Matthew Prior in one lot
were disposed of at £140. The letters of Charles, Duke
of Richmond (1735-1806), to Lady Louisa Conolly
almost failed to find buyers, although in reality they
were little less historically important than those of
Lord Holland. It must not be forgotten that the
MSS. of Sir Thomas Hanmer were sold with those
of the Hanbury family. An A.L.S. of Sir Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">{369}</a></span>
Steele to Sir T. Hanmer fetched £25 10s., and one
of Swift £18 10s. I am quite unable to understand
why a letter of Benjamin West should have brought
£24 10s., while a long political letter of the Duke of
Wellington to Colonel Bunbury sold for only £6.
In these two last lots there were the makings of two
books, but Mr. Quaritch obtained the whole of the
MSS. relating to the affairs of the Mediterranean,
1806-14, for £35, and those connected with the
War in Germany and in Belgium, 1813-15, for £5
more.</p>

<p>The next sale devoted solely to autographs took
place at "Sotheby's" on July 8, 1905. It was
essentially a Trafalgar commemoration, and 215 lots
made a total of £1,034 14s.</p>

<p>In this sale a very curious letter of General
Dumouriez to "My good and glorious Nelson,"
written in English, was purchased for the British
Museum by Mr. Quaritch at the low price of
£3 7s. 6d.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> I must content myself with giving the
price of the principal Nelson letters now sold.</p>

<p>The official dispatch announcing the Battle of
Trafalgar and the death of Nelson, from Lord
Collingwood to the "Rt. Honble. Lord Robert
Fitzgerald, Minister Plenipotentiary, Ambassador at
Lisbon," dated October 24, 1805, was purchased by
Mr. Sabin for £95. Five letters from Lady Hamilton
to Mr. George Rose, Mr. C. F. Greville, and
Lord Stowell, were sold for £12, £13 10s.,
and £27 respectively. Just at the end of this
sale two letters of Shelley realised £38 and £20
respectively.</p>

<p>There was another three-days' autograph sale at
"Sotheby's" on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of July of
this year. The 1,087 lots included in it brought a
sum total of £1,578 8s.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1906 Mr. Frederick Barker, who
was held in high esteem as an autograph expert,
died, and three sales were devoted to the dispersal of
his MSS., but these sales call for no note. In fact,
they were felt to be disappointing. Most of Mr.
Barker's best "finds" had been parted with during
his lifetime. The first of the Barker sales commenced
on December 18, 1905. Almost simultaneously
the Irving relics were dispersed at
"Christie's." Amongst them were a few autographs.
The death of the famous actor caused a sudden rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">{371}</a></span>
in the price of his letters, but it has since subsided.
On the night before his tragic death Irving had
signed a few portrait postcards for my friend Mr.
Peter Keary, who has very kindly given me one of
them.</p>

<p>The three days of the Barker Sale, with 910 lots,
only brought £916 12s. 6d. It should be noted that
the price of Nelson autographs since the centenary
year of his death has been well maintained, and the
writer is well aware that some of the very best of his
letters have still to come into the market. Possibly
they never will.</p>

<p>The sales of the following year opened with the
dispersal of Mr. Barker's Royal autographs on
January 22nd. On February 19th, 279 lots belonging
to him and relating to Napoleon fetched only
£147 5s. 6d. There was another autograph sale at
"Sotheby's" on February 26, 1906, when 327 lots
yielded £779 18s. Nelsonians were still very much
to the fore.</p>

<p>An important bundle of Temple-Greville-Lyttelton-Pitt
MSS. was sold for £10 15s. I also notice
the following interesting items:&mdash;</p>

sale, March 27-31, 1906, Ben Jonson's Bible with
the words <i>Benedica Dominum in omni tempore Semper
laus eius in ore meo</i> (Psa. xxxii.), fetched £320. A
2 pp. folio A.L.S. of General Washington (July 20,
1788) was sold for £26 10s., and a number of documents
signed by Napoleon averaged about £3. One
page of holograph notes in pencil, made at St.
Helena by Napoleon, and relating to "Montholon's
Mémoires," fetched £16 5s. and another £10. A
series of documents and letters signed by Napoleon
III. averaged from 1s. to 2s.! The autograph
section of this sale, including only 123 lots, realised
£981 13s.</p>

<p>The autograph sale of May 19th, at "Sotheby's,"

<p>The sale of July 9-10, 1906, attracted a crowd of
Wesley autograph buyers. The 296 lots sold realised
a total of £1,069 17s. 6d. The seven unpublished
letters of Wesley fetched from £2 to £9 5s.&mdash;averaging
over £4. Oliver Goldsmith's desk-chair figured
between some copies of letters by Frederick the
Great and the probate of a Wesley will. It went for
£39. Another sale on December 1st, comprising
242 lots, brought a total of £725 14s. In this sale
some letters of the actress "Kitty Clive" were sold
at £17 and £3 3s. respectively. The latter had been
mutilated.</p>

<p>The autograph season of 1907 began with a two-days'
sale at "Sotheby's"&mdash;January 21st-22nd. The
743 lots disposed of realised a total of £1,210 14s. 6d.
Another series of eleven Disraeli letters was sold
at good prices, ranging from £9 12s. 6d. ("Heard
Macaulay's best speech ... but between ourselves
I could floor them all. This <i>entress nous</i>

£2 12s. In this sale Messrs. Maggs acquired a series
of twenty-five letters of Johnson to Mrs. Piozzi for
£240. Mrs. Mainwaring, of Brynbella, gave £94 for
five volumes of "Piozziana," presented by the writer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">{374}</a></span>
H. L. Piozzi, in 1810, to her adopted nephew and

1907, Messrs. Sotheby disposed of 459 lots for
£1,101 19s. A series of letters about Keats,
addressed to John Taylor the publisher, was sold
for £44; a notable advance was made in the price of
Thackeray letters; Disraeli letters showed a distinct
fall, one selling for only 16s., and a very fine letter
of Samuel Pepys, covering four folio pages, went to
Mr. Sabin for £22. The 315 lots sold on November
8th realised £1,095. For thirty-six letters addressed
to Lady Blessington, by Thackeray, Dickens, and
others, Mr. Sabin gave £315. A single letter of
Shelley's brought £46, and six letters of Byron to
Trelawny £70. A letter of Charles I. to the Elector
Palatine went to the late Mr. W. Brown for £56.</p>

<p>On March 10-11, 1908, a two-days' autograph sale
of 557 lots realised a total of £1,191. A number of
Nelson documents, the property of the late Viscount
Bridport, Duke of Bronté, were sold for £125.</p>

<p>Six days in June were taken up by the sale of
autographs. On June 1, 254 lots realised £260. At
this sale I secured for 5s. two most interesting letters
of Captain Wright, whose death in the Temple
(October, 1805) brought so much obloquy on
Napoleon.</p>

<p>Messrs. Sotheby devoted no less than four days
(June 15th-18th) to the dispersal of another section
of the Phillipps Library. The 855 lots brought
£3,796 19s. The sale was devoid of any sensational
Incidents.</p>

<p>On July 3rd, 252 lots were sold in Wellington
Street for £415 18s. Sixteen important letters of
Mr. Gladstone sold for £4 10s., and I secured several
very interesting Disraeli letters at prices varying from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">{375}</a></span>
15s. to 21s. At this sale Disraeli letters went as low
as 2s., 3s., 5s., and 7s. A fine series of Thomas
Carlyle letters varied in price from £2 2s. to £8 15s.
The Sir Arthur Vicars' sale of heraldic and
genealogical MSS. (July 27th-28th) excited some
interest. The 671 lots brought a total of £1,571 10s.
The sale of November 16-17, 1908, was of more than
ordinary interest, and the 334 lots of which it was
made up realised £1,007 9s. Amongst the interesting
MSS. disposed of were&mdash;</p>

<p>The season of 1909 opened with the Stoddart Sale
of historical MSS. (February 22nd-23rd). In this sale
404 lots brought £510 6s. The fine A.L.S. of Mrs.
Siddons, now in my collection, fetched £12 5s., or £2
less than it did thirty years ago. The price of Nelson
letters was well maintained, a small collection of
them, with portraits and sundry relics, fetching £145.
A letter to Lady Hamilton, dated March 23, 1801,
although covering only half a page, went for £31.
On March 1st (a one-day's sale) 201 lots brought
£798 2s. 6d. A short letter of Keats sold for
£25 10s., two A.L.S. of James Wolfe for £35 10s.,
and a fine holograph letter of Raphael Sanzio
d'Urbino for £41. A series of MSS. relating to
the American War of Independence (including four
letters and documents signed by Washington) was
purchased by Messrs. Maggs for £40. I have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">{376}</a></span>
alluded to the sale of June 9th-10th, from which the
Windham correspondence was withdrawn. The remaining
524 lots realised no less than £2,145 10s. 6d.
A series of twenty-four Nelson letters and other MSS.
relating to him was purchased by Mr. Sabin for
£121, a very low price considering that fourteen
letters of Lady Hamilton went with the others, as
well as Nelson's original will and seven codicils,
<i>from which eight signatures had been removed!</i> Mr.
Quaritch, at this sale, gave £275 for the correspondence
of John Robinson, Secretary of the
Treasury, 1770 to 1782, which included 194 letters
from George III. These MSS. have an important
bearing on both American and British history, and
ought to have been acquired by the nation along with
the Windham papers. A one-day's sale on July 22nd,
consisting of only 269 lots, realised £1,113 14s. 6d.,
and another on December 17th, composed of 269 lots,
brought a total of £1,318 6s. A rise in price at both
these sales was very marked. In the first a song of
Burns (2 pp.) fetched £57, and two unpublished
letters of Lord Byron £17 10s. and £28 respectively.
£20 was paid for some notes of Goethe in pencil,
and £40 for a 2 pp. 8vo letter of Shelley. It was in
the latter that the twenty-four letters of Beethoven
were sold for £660. On the same day Mr. Cromwell
gave £31 for an exceedingly interesting letter
addressed to the Genevan Senate, signed by Oliver
Cromwell.</p>

<p>On the 28th of January of the present year (1910) 264
lots realised £742 13s. 6d. It was on this occasion
that £50 was given for an 8½ pp. 8vo letter of
Charlotte Brontë. It is doubtless a high price, but
only just before Mr. Sabin paid £17 10s. for a letter
of Mr. R. Waldo Emerson to Thomas Carlyle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">{377}</a></span>
(October 7, 1835), and Mr. Quaritch gave £56 for a
2 pp. 4to letter of George Washington to S. Powell
(May 25, 1786). Within a few days no less than £81
was expended on a blue Hawaian postage-stamp, in
Leicester Square. About a quarter of that sum
gave Mr. Sabin, on February 28th, a long holograph
poem of Frederick the Great addressed to Algarotti,
beginning with the lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My trembling timid pen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Presents its first attempt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the rigid public censor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To assure it against attacks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May Minerva guide it.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The cost of the Hawaian "specimen" would have
sufficed to buy both the poem of the Prussian King
and Charlotte Brontë's touching confession that the
"only glimpses of society she ever had were obtained
in her vocation of governess," and her earnest appeal
to the necessity of a creed.</p>

Félicité Ducrest, Comtesse de," and so escaped attention.
The principal witnesses are Philippe Égalité, Duc d'Orléans,
and General Valence. The bride is described as "Citizen
Anne Caroline Stéphanie Sims, aged 19, living in Paris, known
in France by the name of Pamela, a native of Fago in Newfoundland
and daughter of William Brixeij (<i>sic</i>) and Mary
Sims." The bridegroom is said to be "Edward FitzGerald,
aged 29, generally living in Dublin, Ireland, a native of
Whitehall, London, and the son of James FitzGerald de
Leinster and Dame Amélie Lennox de Leinster." The Duke
of Orléans figures in the deed only as Citizen Louis Philippe
Égalité.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The publisher of Autograph Catalogues invariably adopts
the following convenient abbreviations: A. L. S. (autograph
letter signed), A. L. (autograph letter unsigned), A. N. S.
(autograph note signed), D. S. (document signed). In France
L. A. S. indicates an autograph letter signed and P. S. (<i>pièce

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Dr. Scott says: "Various suggestions have been offered
for the restoration of vanished writing and of ink which has
faded, such as a solution of sulphide of ammonium washed
over the writing, previously moistened with water or a
decoction of nut-galls, but great care must be exercised so
as not to injure valuable documents. Indeed, I cannot too
often repeat the warning that the less autographs are manipulated
or altered from their original state the better. The way
in which so many fine old letters have had their margins
trimmed to remove the ragged edges years ago is a dreadful
eye-sore to the collector, who, of course, likes to see the
sheets of paper of the proper orthodox size, with large spaces
around the writing. Damping the ink should, if possible,
be carefully avoided, for there is something precious and
inimitable in the fine, indescribable tint which age alone
gives to writing."</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
